description: '<p>Unison Research has been admired and appreciated worldwide over the last 30 years. From the beginning, our goal has always been to convey pleasure by listening to music. We have focused our experience on the production of valves and on the design of hybrid electronics. It takes real passion to create products that provide the gift of timeless pleasure.</p><p>All Unison Research products are characterized by an elegant style, and the care with which wood and metal parts are selected for each design. It’s a quality that is recognized and appreciated worldwide.</p><p>We firmly believe that a system of high-fidelity music reproduction should not only be a pleasure to hear, but to see as well.</p><p>Unison Research was founded in 1987 by a group of passionate audiophiles led by Giovanni Maria Sacchetti. Born in 1945, Giovanni Maria Sacchetti devoted himself at an early age to the study and design of hi-fi systems, combining his interest in electronics with a passion for music inherited from his father, an expert pianist.After completing his studies in electronics, he devoted twenty-five years to teaching while at the same time designing and developing amplifiers for Unison Research.</p><p>The first integrated amplifier he designed for Unison Research was the TRIODE20. Its successor, the SIMPLY TWO, was a key step forward in the company’s history—this legendary amplifier was instrumental in achieving great international success for Unison Research in a relatively short time.</p><p>Our experience has increased over the years, along with our continuing research of high performance and high quality standards. This has led Unison Research to both historical achievements and great value when it comes to the development of our products. Best of all, we have achieved this through a completely Italian operation…from design to production.</p><p>Unison Research is now recognized as the Italian leader in the production of tube amplifiers, and among the top ten in Europe.</p>'
