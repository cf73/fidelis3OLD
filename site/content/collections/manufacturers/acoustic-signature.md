description: '<p>Since Acoustic Signature invented the ‘Silencer Platter’ in 2000 they have continuously improved the performance results and have now achieved platter damping that is unbeaten by any other product. The gold plated Silencers are certainly visually attractive and make the Acoustic Signature turntables even more desirable. But the silencers were added for reasons much more important than their good looks.<br>The Silencers absorb and reduce vibrations while you listen to a vinyl disk playing. These vibrations come from different sources such as:</p><ul><li>The cartridge needle puts vibration back into the record as it tracks the groove, causing vibration in the whole Vinyl record. This leads to ‘micro’ miss-tracking of the cartridge, when picked up by the needle alongside the actual signal you want from the track, with a very small time delay between the two. The Silencers in the platter absorb some of this unwanted vibration and improve the sound reproduction dramatically.</li></ul><ul><li>Airwaves hitting the platter and turntable body from your loudspeakers. Your cartridge/stylus doesn´t care where movement comes from, be it the grooves or other vibrations – it simply produces an electrical signal when vibrating causing loss of detail resolution and imaging from your precious vinyl records. The Silencers absorb these unwanted vibrations, leading to a huge improvement in sound fidelity, improving your listening experience.</li></ul><p><br></p>'
