description: '<p><strong><em>Hardwood is resilient and durable. Hardwood acts as nature’s solution for the absorption and dissipation of the energy that causes vibration. Made in the USA since 1881, Wood Welded produces the world’s finest butcher block. They have invested in timberlands and acres of space to allow the lumber to air dry until thoroughly seasoned. And the craftsmen that create our isolation platforms belong to families that have been on the job for generations. If you own a Butcher Block Acoustics Audio Platform, the laminated pieces of wood come together in a unique pattern of colors and grain – resulting in its own sound… The warm, rich sound of hardwood. Audio Platforms, Anti-Vibration Accessories and Hardwood Audio Racks… Butcher Block Acoustics - The Audiophile’s Choice.</em></strong></p>'
