description: '<p>Snell Acoustic A II Full-Range Loudspeakers. Speakers are in great working condition - wood needs a few coatings of oil and grills need a pill-buster taken to them, but overall they are a 7/10 - 8/10 considering the age. This was a world-class speaker in its day and Peter Snell was one of our industries foremost designers before he died. We were surprised at how good these still sound - even against modern competition that is significantly more expensive. These are a bargain and will make someone with the right room/system a fabulous speaker!</p>'
