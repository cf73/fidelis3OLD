As well as digital coaxial, HDMI, USB and S/PDIF connections, there’s also Chromecast built-in, Spotify Connect, TIDAL, Qobuz, AirPlay, Bluetooth aptX HD, Internet Radio and UPnP Playback. Roon Ready certification enhances your browsing experience. Wherever songs are played from, Edge NQ stays true to the character of every instrument and uncovers a musicality you’ve never heard before.&nbsp; With a wealth of connections including digital coaxial, ARC (Audio Return Channel), USB and S/PDIF, our engineers have ensured that all of your digital content can be enjoyed, at up to 32bit/384kHz and DSD 256. Edge NQ offers an incredibly revealing sound that has detailed tone, rhythmic drive and taut bass. Edge NQ&nbsp;was designed with a unique PCB. Our engineers replaced conventional capacitors with a DC coupled topology and also added a solid state volume control. The end result is a clean signal path that’s perfectly balanced at any volume. Edge NQ boasts the very latest version of our award-winning streaming module. Designed in-house, right here in the UK, it features a new, faster chipset and support for both 24bit/192kHz and DSD128 files. The addition of Spotify Connect, TIDAL, Qobuz, AirPlay, Bluetooth aptX HD and Internet radio means you can enjoy your music whatever the source.

    excerpt: '<p>Accomplished is a word we can use to describe the Cambridge Audio Edge NQ itself. It is a top-class streamer and a rather fine analogue preamplifier too. Add a hugely capable DAC section, and an impressive headphone amplifier, and you have quite some product – all packed into one gorgeous unit to boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
