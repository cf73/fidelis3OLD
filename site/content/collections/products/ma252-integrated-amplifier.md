quote: 'It looks like a McIntosh. It sounds like a McIntosh. It’s built like a McIntosh (and in Binghamton, NY, like all other McIntosh products). But despite the fact it’s certainly aspirational, it won’t require you to aspire quite as much as most other products wearing McIntosh livery.'

    excerpt: '<p>Apart from being tough and cost-effective, though, the most laudable attribute of the McIntosh MA252 is that sonically it brings its owner more than a taste of what much loftier-priced high-end audio promises. The ability to connect the listener to the music makes this tube-solid state integrated a special component by any standard. I could happily listen to the MA252 for a long, long time.</p>'
