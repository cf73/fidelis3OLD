description: '<p>Not long ago, the Signature Mk IIa was the finest preamplifier you could buy. In production since 2000, this enduring classic marked the introduction of the basic, fully balanced, zero-feedback, transformer-coupled Class A1 triode topology found in all contemporary VAC preamplifiers. Even from this early form, it preserves and reproduces the emotion and vitality of music and maximizes the performances of the associated source components and power amplifiers.</p>'
