quote: 'The Emit M10s unfurled a wall-to-wall soundstage with great depth as I played Brian Eno''s new album, "The Ship." The first track is a rambling, ambient trip, with a churning low bass foundation that I could hardly believe was coming from speakers as small as these.'

description: '<h3>Who would’ve thought ‘entry-level’ could be so good?</h3><p>It might be the introductory end of our range, but we’ve made zero compromises when it comes to sound quality. We just can’t bring ourselves to do that.</p>'
