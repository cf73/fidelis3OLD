quote: 'Due to some terrific design and engineering, the Sonus faber Sonetto III produces much bigger sound than a speaker its size has a right to. If you’re tight on space and thought you’d have to settle for a bookshelf design, think again.'

description: '<p>ITALIAN TRADITIONAL CULTURE</p><p>Sonus faber always found its inspiration in the highest Italian culture. This time we entrusted the history of our Literature for representing the new Sonetto Collection.</p><p>The Sonetto (Sonnet) is the most ancient Italian Poetic structure. Originally it meant “Sound, Melody“and was traditionally used to accompany music performances. The first step in the Sonus faber world brings the name of the foundations of Literature history in Italy and in the rest of the world.</p><p>AN HARMONIOUS SHAPE</p><p>Looks can be deceiving. Despite its slim dimensions, Sonetto III has the commanding presence of a much larger speaker, thanks to advanced technologies and design solutions. Sonetto III completes the floor standing loudspeakers range of the collection.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>The Sonetto IIIs could well be the answer. And if you have placement restrictions, the Sonettos are more forgiving than most floorstanders. The Sonetto IIIs have such a wonderful ability to reproduce lifelike midrange and midbass that you''ll often forget you''re listening to speakers.</p>'
