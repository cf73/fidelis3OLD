description: '<h3><br></h3><p>Olympica I represents a breakthrough in the resonance spectrum control and natural sound reproduction thanks to the triple curvature of the cabinet profile, the progressive thickness of internal walls and to the overall structure rigidity.Innovation for us means to know how to make the speakers disappear in the environment, with an elegant and graceful style. Sonus faber Olympica I lets the Music be the unique protagonist, enhancing the sound in all its details and power.</p><p><br></p>'

    excerpt: '<p>If I had to sum up the Olympica I sound in a single word, it would be ‘exquisite’. The Olympica makes the right balance between the rose-tinted sound of old and the requirements for a more accurate and clean loudspeaker today.</p>'
