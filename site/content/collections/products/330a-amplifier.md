quote: 'The MOON 330A Power Amplifier represents not only an amazing value, but also amazing sound, period. It delivers a tight, extended and superbly authorative bass with power, weight and articulation. Vocals and cymbals float in a musical space filled with the air and natural ambience of a musical performance. When mated with the 390 Network Player / Preamplifier, the combination provides a musical performance so complete and satisfying that one wonders if it can get any better.'

    excerpt: '<p>&nbsp;I have totally fallen in love with the sound, the functionality, the look and the quality of these Canadian beasts. Playing music has never been more pleasurable than it has been these past few weeks - I would happily spend the rest of my life with these Moon pieces at the heart of my system. Make no mistake, they are irresistible. Only audition if you are ready to handover the money to your friendly Moon retailer!</p><p><br></p>'
