quote: 'Time spent with the Acoustic Signature Storm was anything but “stormy”. Instead with every play I kept referring to it as “old faithful”—not that I ever took its performance for granted!'

description: '<p>The STORM 2018 offers rock solid and tuneful bass, a stable and focused midrange, clear and detailed high frequency reproduction by producing a soundstage that delivers both – natural delicate musicality and great authority. Of course, STORM 2018 also has very low mechanical noise courtesy based on our unique Tidorfolon-bearing design, and an externally positioned motor, run by our Beta-DIG regenerative power supply to ensure perfect rotation of the new platter.</p><p>The STORM 2018 comes with a precisely manufactured aluminum platter has a weight of 11 kg which includes 8 Silencer modules to dampen resonances. The platter is additionally coated underneath with a specialized high efficiency damping material to achieve even better results. This high mass platter in combination with the smooth running Tidorfolon-bearing is only one of the many unique reasons why the STORM 2018 excels, and provides an unparalleled musical experience and turntable performance in its price range.</p>'
