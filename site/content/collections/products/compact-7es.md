description: '<p>Whatever you ask of the Compact 7ES-3, it always delivers: perfectly. The clarity is spellbinding and brings the ‘magic carpet ride’ experience to the listening room in a medium-sized enclosure.</p><p>The world-class HL Compact 7ES-3 takes the ultra-clean Harbeth-exclusive RADIAL2 cone technology to another performance level. This medium-sized loudspeaker combines natural sound with a flair for reproducing any and every type of music.</p><p>The Harbeth secret for natural sound is the result of the meticulous attention to detail.</p><p>Critically important, but hidden, is the crossover for seamless integration of the drive units across a wider horizontal and vertical arc meaning that the Compact 7ES-3 is far less critical of stand height than many speakers of this size.</p>'
