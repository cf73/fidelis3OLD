quote: 'The tired old tubes v. transistors debate isn’t the point here. What is the point is that this quality of musical delivery, excellence of overall balance, and ability to draw us into and hold us with the music is what for me differentiates the finest components from the rest of the pack. In that regard Exposure’s 3010S2 mono amps not only rank among the best of class, they also do so while delivering outstanding value.'

    excerpt: '<p>Back in 2008 I wrote very favorably about a CD player and integrated amplifier from Exposure’s 3010S Series. These components fell into the highly competitive mid-$2000 price range, which is reachable by most non-one-percenters and marks a price point from which you generally need to make a big leap to get significantly better performance. Both 3010S designs delivered a very engaging sound that I described as “beautifully balancing detail with warmth, rhythmic precision with lyricism, and delicacy with power.”</p><p>The 3010S Series, one from the top of Exposure’s 4-Series lineup, has since received a bit of an upgrade—hence the “2” designation—and my experience with the 3010S2 mono power amplifier ($3195 the pair) only strengthens my conviction that Exposure is building some of the highest-value gear on the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
