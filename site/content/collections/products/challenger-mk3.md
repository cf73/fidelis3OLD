  would recommend the Challenger Mk3 to any analog lover whose budget accommodates its roughly $5k price (depending on tonearm and cartridge choices)—and particularly for audiophiles ready to take that next step from more basic components into the world of reference-level gear.
  In spite of the generously long review period, I’m hoping to find a way to hang on to this turntable, which offers no tricks, no gimmicks, just the musical goods. Call it a Challenger that punches way above its weight.
