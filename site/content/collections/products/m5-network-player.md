    excerpt: '<p><br>The M5 is built extremely well and absolutely&nbsp;has the looks to fit a true high end audio device, but it also has sound to match its looks. It has superbly deep, powerful and tuneful bass, rich and smooth mids and fluid, airy treble and overall it is easily the most organic sounding Roon endpoint that I have heard. If there is one thing that the M5 does not do, it is sounding&nbsp;<em>digital</em>!</p>'
