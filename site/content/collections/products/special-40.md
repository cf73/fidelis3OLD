  "Tonally, the Special Forty is smooth and easy, but as I continued to listen it was the speakers' clarity and resolution that made the biggest impressions."
  
  "The little speakers can play surprisingly loud in small- to midsized rooms. The sound had a deliciously organic feel to it."

    excerpt: '<p>the Dynaudio Special Forty should be viewed (and heard) as splendid sounding pieces of audio furniture.&nbsp;Loudspeakers that dance on the grave of the audio reviewer cliché that ‘they look as good as they sound’.</p>'
