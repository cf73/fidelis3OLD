description: '<p>The Top of the Range Prestige Series Headphone, the SR325e has&nbsp;a new driver and cable design.&nbsp;The added mass from the metal housing&nbsp;minimizes transient distortions. With the new 8 conductor cable design you will notice&nbsp;superb control and stability of the upper and lower range of the frequency spectrum, with both&nbsp;supporting Grado''s world renowned midrange. The SR325e will produce a sound that is pure Grado, with warm harmonic colors, rich full bodied vocals, excellent dynamics, and an ultra-smooth top end.</p>'
