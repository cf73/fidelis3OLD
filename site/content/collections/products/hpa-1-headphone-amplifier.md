description: '<p>The HPA-1 headphone amplifier was designed ground-up to become what we believe is one of the very best sounding headphone amplifiers available today. With low feedback, wide bandwidth and a direct coupled MOSFET output stage, this musical instrument drives even the most difficult headphone loads with ease, power and grace. The HPA-1 also functions as a line-level preamplifier that sonically rivals much higher-priced competition. The measured performance is superb and the sound even better.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>As balanced headphone operation is the audio fashion du jour, it might be felt that Pass Labs''s sticking with single-ended operation could work against the HPA-1. But regardless of circuit topology and the active devices, it''s the sound quality that matters, and on that count the HPA-1 scores big-time. Yes, it''s an expensive headphone amplifier; but I venture to suggest that, in bass clarity and&nbsp;<i>authority</i>&nbsp;and in midrange transparency, the Pass Labs HPA-1 is without peer.</p>'
