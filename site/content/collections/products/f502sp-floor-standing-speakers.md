quote: 'Fyne Audio’s F502SPs are a vivid listening experience. Massive bass and a fast, forward mid-band make for a sound few other loudspeakers come close to. More charismatic than smooth they offer an alternative to the commonplace. Being very revealing though, as well as demanding, they do need careful amplifier matching.'

description: '<p>Improving on the F502, the UK built SP edition uses the premium 200mm (8″) IsoFlare&nbsp;<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;driver and 200mm (8″) bass/mid driver from the F702, featuring rigid multi-fiber cones and FyneFlute<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;roll surrounds. The IsoFlare’s 25mm magnesium compression tweeter has a unique HF wave guide pole piece delivering an incredibly even, full-range frequency response and outstanding Hi-Fi musical imaging. The F502SP also benefits from the F700’s advanced crossover components and aluminum sandwich type plinth with BassTrax tractrix profile bass diffuser, re-engineered to precisely tune the F502SP’s more compact cabinet. The SP is available in high-gloss black and high gloss white as standard, or a luxurious deep gloss lacquered walnut veneer with a diamond machine cut finish on the aluminum driver chassis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
