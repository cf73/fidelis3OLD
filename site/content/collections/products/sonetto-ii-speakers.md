quote: 'Spec-wise, the Sonus Faber Sonetto IIs are impressive at their price point, seemingly benefiting from considerable “trickle-down” of technology from their more distinguished (and expensive) brethren. Oh, and the craftsmanship is pretty darn nice as well. Take the cabinets — they’re just gorgeous.'

description: '<p>In comparison to Sonetto I, this is a bigger 2-way shelf loudspeaker system. Its high performance features a larger mid-woofer, which is capable of ensuring more wider downwards frequency response and a greater emotional impact. Besides its dimensions, Sonetto II still has the capability to disappear in the environment, with an elegant and graceful style.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>&nbsp;In fact, these speakers are just exceptional. I think of the Sonus Fabers as mood speakers- as in, they put me in the mood! I can close my eyes and visualize myself cruising down the canals of Venice under the light of the stars, or maybe being serenaded along with&nbsp;<em>mia amore</em>&nbsp;by an Italian tenor in the town square. If that doesn’t make you want to smile, then I don’t know what would! Bellissimo!</p>'
