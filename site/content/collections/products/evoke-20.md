quote: 'There’s much to like about the Evoke 20s. The beguiling manner in which they unfold the layers of the music to reveal the hidden details without sounding overly-analytical is to me is the trademark of a high-end speaker.'

description: '<p>Evoke 20 is a full-size stand-mounted speaker designed for almost any sized space. Its powerful 18cm mid/bass driver ensures it can flex its muscles when there’s heavy lifting to be done, while its 28mm soft-dome tweeter takes care of the fine detail. And, of course, its Danish design looks fantastic wherever you put it. It’s an ideal match.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>A mid-range speaker, however, has to achieve a very high level of performance sonically, but it has to be manifested without breaking the bank. Top this off with the mid-range being one of the more competitive speaker segments and you have an idea of the challenges facing the Dynaudio Evoke 20.</p><p>This Danish-based manufacturer has an ace up its sleeve, though – a 40-year legacy of making speakers of distinction to fall back on. In the case of the Evoke range, it has filtered down technologies from its higher-end models into the design, and for all intents and purposes, Dynaudio has done a sterling job.</p>'
