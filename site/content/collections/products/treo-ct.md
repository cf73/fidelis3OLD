description: '<p>The Vandersteen Audio speaker lineup continues to evolve as a result of the research &amp; development efforts that delivered the patented carbon-fiber Perfect-Piston drivers used in the flagship Model Seven. Vandersteen''s Treo loudspeaker is now available in an optional Treo CT version (Carbon Tweeter). The Treo CT delivers a surprising amount of the air, space and natural purity previously heard only in Vandersteen''s top speaker models: the Quatro Wood CT, Model 5A Carbon and the Model Seven.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>When all is said and done, there are speakers we’ve all encountered that, however admirable, are more about quantifying information than reproducing a moving, organic musical event. They might sound lively for a spell, but they lack the heartbeat of musicality. It’s a rookie mistake that only years of experience can ameliorate. Vandersteen Audio, however, is an old-guard veteran, and it shows. It takes just one listen to the Treo CT to recognize that you’re in the presence of a speaker that superbly balances these twin essentials, but never loses sight of where its loyalties lie. In my view, you cannot get a more purely musical loudspeaker in this price range than the Treo CT. A true delight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
