description: '<p>The new Contour 20i has been designed to surpass every other standmount Contour model we’ve created. And it succeeds.</p><p>The new Esotar 2i tweeter is a turbocharged version of the much-loved Esotar2. It now features a larger rear chamber for more effective damping, and the inventive Hexis inner dome seen on Confidence, Core and more. Together they flatten the frequency response and reduce unwanted resonances for even clearer, smoother treble.</p><p>The woofer has been tweaked, too. It’s still made of our own Magnesium Silicate Polymer (MSP) material, of course, it’s still powered by a lightweight aluminium voice-coil, and it still uses a vented dual-ferrite magnet system – but behind the distinctive black cone lurks a brand-new spider suspension. This one is made from aramid fibres, and retains the ingenious structural properties from before (the ribs are of varying width to give even finer control over the cone’s excursion). You’d be surprised at the sonic difference such a small change can make…</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>We’ve long been fans of Dynaudio’s Contour 20 standmounters. Their combination of a muscular and expressive sound coupled with fine build made them a firm recommendation at the price. This latest Contour 20i version aims to build on those solid foundations without altering the fundamentals of a great product.</p><p>On the surface, little seems to have changed between the two generations of Contour 20s. Indeed, compare the headline specifications and they’re pretty much identical. Start to look closer and the differences between the two emerge.</p>'
