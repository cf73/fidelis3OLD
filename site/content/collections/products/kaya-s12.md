description: '<h4>A NEW LISTENING EXPERIENCE</h4><p>Crucially, and despite its diminutive 12 liter internal volume, the KAYA S12 uses the patented exponentially tapered tube loaded reflex, first developed for its much larger sibling, the GIYA G1, but wrapped around the inside of the enclosure in such a way as to absorb resonance in all directions. Enjoying this near-ideal loading is the newly-designed long throw C100D driver delivering clean precise bass and uncolored transparent midrange to a surprisingly high level. High frequencies are handled by the same tapered tube loaded high-performance D26 tweeter used throughout the entire Vivid range. KAYA S12 is molded from composite material available in a range of standard and custom automotive finishes.</p><p>Vivid Audio KAYA S12 Specifications:&nbsp;</p><p>Configuration: 2 way, 2 driver system</p><p>Cabinet material: RIM Cast Polyurethane</p><p>Cabinet Color: Piano Black, Pearl White, Oyster Matte</p><p>Bespoke Color: Available on request</p><p>Drive Units: HF: D26 – 26mm tapered tube loaded alloy dome</p><p>LF: C100D – 1 x 100mm alloy cone</p><p>Bass Loading: Exponentially Tapered Tube enhanced bass reflex</p><p>Sensitivity: 87dB @ 2.83VRMS at 1m on axis</p><p>Nominal Impedance: 8 Ohm (5.3 Ohm Min)</p><p>Frequency Range: 45 – 25,000 Hz (-6dB)</p><p>First D26 Break Up mode: 44,000 Hz</p><p>Harmonic Distortion: (2nd and 3rd harmonics) &lt; 0.5% over frequency range at 1WCross over frequencies (Hz)3,000</p><p>Recommended Amplifier Power: 25W – 125W</p><p>Loudspeaker Dimensions: 400 mm (H) x 237 mm (W) x&nbsp; 254 mm (D)</p><p>Net Weight: 6 kg</p><p>Shipping Dimensions: 480 mm (H) x 250 mm (W) x 270 mm (D)</p><p>Shipping Weight: 8 kg (each)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
