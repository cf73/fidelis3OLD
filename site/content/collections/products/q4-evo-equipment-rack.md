quote: 'Only so much can be said about an equipment rack, but the Quadraspire is at the top of my list for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, it makes an audible difference in the system.  Second, it is tastefully designed and should fit well into any decor scheme.'

description: '<p>In the same way as every musical performance needs a stage so a HiFi needs a stage to bring the music to life in your home. In 1995 we set out to develop a modular rack – the Q4 – that could support a variety of Hi Fi systems and deliver acoustic performance with style. This was achieved by combining solid aluminium columns with specially engineered shelves to create a light and rigid construction to deliver a clearer, cleaner musical performance.</p>'
