description: '<p>Super HeavyWeight Champion represents the next level of groove-noise-reduction technology. Designed with Mike Latvis of Harmonic Resolution Systems for use with mid-to-high-mass turntable platters, it features a proprietary, ultra-dense, precision-molded polymer created for exceptional noise-absorption characteristics. In addition to coupling the LP to the platter, Super HeavyWeight Champion significantly reduces noise—specifically, record groove, motor, and bearing noise. You will hear more music due to resultant blacker backgrounds, improved clarity, enhanced microdynamics, and greater bass impact.</p>'
