quote: 'We can dance around this, but the Sonus faber Olympica II represents the right answer to an increasingly important question in audio: Can we have style AND substance? The usual answer is to dismiss anything that looks good with a wave of the hand, mumbling something about ‘style over substance’ in the process. The Olympica range makes a strong case for the importance of both.'

description: '<p>The wood undergoes a long aging phase before reaching the final stability and being used for the cabinet construction of our high-end loudspeaker as it happens for the musical instruments creation.</p><p>The search for the highest sophistication in acoustics, the artistic and aesthetic investigation linked to classicism, the look towards the modern knowledge: these are the main factors that link Olympica with the grandiose work of Andrea Palladio, which has been the inspiration in its creation and evolution.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>Sonus Faber seems to make pieces of musical furniture with the sort of timeless, trans-national elegance of a chair designed by Charles and Ray Eames, Arne Jacobsen, or Mies van der Rohe. In most cases, this would be hyperbole on a grand scale. Except that it isn’t; Sonus Faber in general and the Olympica range in particular is an exercise in sublime product design.</p>'
