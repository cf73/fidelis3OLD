    excerpt: |
      <p>Historically, Rega has proved
      highly adept at making affordable
      high performance vinyl spinners,
      and the latest Planar 2 shows
      why. It feels much less built-down to-a-price than its rivals, and is
      more solid, better finished and
      smarter looking too. Then there’s
      the sound, which is far more
      musically enjoyable than you have
      any right to expect for just £375.
      Its painless, straight out of the
      box set-up is a real bonus too!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
