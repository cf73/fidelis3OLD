    excerpt: '<p>Kudos to Mr. Dickie, as his latest line of speakers is an unqualified success. I found the cabinets to have surprisingly little vibration even at high listening levels, and the internal loading characteristics let the Kayas play with very little distortion or shift in character regardless of volume level. I know of dealers who have replaced Wilson Audio with Vivid Audio and that is no small compliment. I''ve been doing high-end audio reviews for the last 20 years, and the Vivid Audio Kaya 90 is one of the most impressive products I have had the pleasure of reviewing. I will be very sad to see this pair go.</p><p><br></p>'
