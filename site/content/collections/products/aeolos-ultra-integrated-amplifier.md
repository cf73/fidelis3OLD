quote: 'The Aeolos Super Plus does all the right things in the right places. It’s decidedly European in design and build, without costing a fortune. It sounds like a good valve amp always did, before they became synonymous with ‘warm and rich’ sounds. And it’s unpretentious and doesn’t cost a fortune.'

    excerpt: '<p>It’s easy to make a cheap valve amp today. It’s a lot harder to make one that’s cheap, good, and built on this side of the planet. And yet, somehow, Tsakiridis Devices manages to design and build quality valve amps that don’t cost a fortune, all from its base in Athens, Greece. The Aeolos, Aeolos Plus and now Aeolos Super Plus are currently the brand’s only integrated designs, with an additional seven different power amplifiers, two preamps, a phono stage, and three power conditioners elsewhere in the catalogue. All in the realm of ‘affordable high-end’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
