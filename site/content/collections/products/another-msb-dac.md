quote: 'With two prime DACs, we yield an unprecedented level of detail, reproducing the musicality, soundstage, and texture of an original performance, bringing the artist to you. A fully balanced, ultra-high precision, discrete ladder DAC architecture ensures each note tells a story. Additionally, MSB’s robust in-house design enables the finest quality playback of PCM and native DSD, while our low impedance circuitry drives your amplification directly without adding coloration or buffering noise. The end result is a digital experience defying expectations.'

The end result is a digital experience defying expectations.</p><p>Equipped with high-visibility and a wide viewing angle, the display is both easy-to-read and stunning, exhibiting our love for intuitive features. &nbsp;The LED display, slaved to the audio clock, is refreshed between data processing to drastically reduce electrical interference. The in-house discrete design is then constructed into its own shielded CNC pocket for optimal isolation. Sit back and be immersed.</p><p>MSB thrives off the innovation required to meet consumer demands. We’re constantly improving digital input modules to stay at the forefront of the high-end audio industry, ensuring you’re always equipped with the most current digital file formats and interfaces. Focusing on our network renderer and USB input, your audio tech will be on the cutting edge. Put simply, your DAC is ready for the future.</p><p>The MSB Renderer was developed using an in-house hardware design running an ultra low noise A5 processor for optimal audio playback performance. Over the air updates will ensure that your renderer always has the latest capabilities and ultimate convenience.</p><p>– Up to 32 bit – 768kHz<br>– MQA decoding<br>– Roon Endpoint<br>– Up to 4X DSD<br>– UPnP Protocol</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>The first three letters of this 25-year-old family business stand for ''Most Significant Bit'' and how well this name fits with their products is proven by the now legendary MSB Reference and Select D / A converters.&nbsp;Truly beautiful machines that have moved the state-of-the-art a lot further, but are also extremely expensive.&nbsp;To accommodate the less wealthy music lover while retaining many of these qualities, MSB has released the Discrete DAC.</p>'
