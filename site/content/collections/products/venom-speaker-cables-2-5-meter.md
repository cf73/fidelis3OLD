description: '<p><strong>‌‌ArNi</strong><sup>®&nbsp;</sup>wire was designed by Shunyata Research to be the finest quality wire available. It begins with the highest purity of copper and silver metals available, including Ohno (<em>single crystal</em>), PCOCC silver and OFE C0101 conductors.&nbsp;Fluorocarbon dielectrics, usually only found in aerospace applications that have exceptional electrical characteristics including extremely low dielectric absorption, high dielectric strength and superb heat resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;When used in digital wiring it significantly reduces transient energy storage and release which affects phase noise performance.</p><p><strong>VTX™</strong>&nbsp;— Shunyata Research’s exclusive VTX™ conductors are formed into a virtual tube with the core of the conductor being hollow. This ensures that all the current flows through the outer periphery of the conductor which minimizes skin effects and random eddy currents.&nbsp; VTX™ conductors are made with single crystal Ohno, certified OFE or silver wire.</p><p>Shunyata Research uses only the highest purity of copper available for the production of its wire products.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>OFE Alloy 101</strong>&nbsp;or C10100 is the highest grade of copper with a&nbsp;<i>minimum</i>&nbsp;99.99% purity and a conductivity rating of 101% IACS. OFE stands for&nbsp;<i>oxygen-free electrolytic</i>&nbsp;and supersedes the term OFHC (<i>oxygen-free high conductivity</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;C10100 is the&nbsp;<i>only</i>&nbsp;grade of copper that comes with a written certification of purity.</p><p>Simple crimping, soldering, brazing and screws are all inferior methods of joining two wires or terminals together. Sonic welding uses high-energy sonic waves to literally join two metals together at a molecular level and cold-welding uses high-energy pneumatic pressure to bond metals. Shunyata Research uses both methods to secure connections that do not degrade over time.</p><p>—<i>&nbsp;Superior contact and wire connections.</i></p>'
