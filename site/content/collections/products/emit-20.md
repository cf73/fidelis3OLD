description: '<p>The Emit M20 is ideal for small - to medium-sized rooms or anywhere where space is limited – such as on a bookshelf or sideboard. You get a 17cm mid/bass driver designed to fill mid-size and larger rooms. The 28mm soft-dome tweeter remains, of course; we’ve spent 40 years working on our tweeters, and until one of our engineers rushes in brandishing something revolutionary and shouting “I’ve done it!” (which, admittedly, does sometimes happen), we see no reason to change.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>While that’s further proof of their transparency, it’s also a warning that you won’t get the best from them playing below-par recordings.</p><p>Nor will you by shoving them up against a back wall, for when it comes to placement they require a bit of room to hit the right tonal balance.</p><p>Toeing them in slightly helps with stereo imaging too, so that when we finish our testing with Traffic’s&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4nuoe3vmGgtCdTQqaIIn2D"><em>John Barleycorn Must Die</em></a>, tambourines, flutes and guitar plucking are all precisely mapped on the sonic landscape.</p>'
