description: '<p>Ultimate performance. Ultimate quality. Ultimate innovation. Meet the new flagship of Dynaudio’s most advanced speaker range</p><p>Sometimes size&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;matter. The all-new Confidence 60, the flagship of the new Confidence family, towers above the outgoing Confidence C4 model.</p><p>It’s unashamedly big; it’s unselfconscious hi-fi royalty. And it sounds like nothing else you’ve heard. Pull up a chair.</p><p>While your ears are captivated by the Confidence 60’s astonishing power, scale and detail, your eyes will probably be drawn to the single Esotar3 28mm soft-dome tweeter in the middle. Then the twin 15cm MSP midrange drivers with Horizon Surrounds. And, finally to the two 23cm MSP NeoTec Woofers.</p><p>The drivers are all new. And they’re all part of the next generation of our innovative DDC (Dynaudio Directivity Control) sound-shaping technology platform. This focuses the sound waves radiating from the speakers into a tight vertical ‘beam’ that avoids reflections from floors and ceilings while maintaining a wide horizontal image. That means a bigger sweet-spot on the couch, a happier audience, and the knowledge that you’re only hearing what the drivers are producing – and not what the room itself is bringing to the party.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dynaudio.com/dynaudio-academy/2019/march/new-podcast-building-confidence">(Something you can learn more about in our six-part podcast series on the new Confidence).</a></p>'
