description: '<p>One of our most popular products, the multi accolade and award-winning Podium Reference is a four-legged hi fi rack constructed from your choice of solid hardwood. The sturdy 40mm plinths provide stiffness and stability, with each standard 595mm wide plinth weighing more than 10kg – adding to the rack’s density as well as absorbing vibration.&nbsp;</p><p>The Podium Reference is a modular rack, with each tier designed to be placed seamlessly on to the next. The 46mm2 solid hardwood legs are removable and can be made to any length at no extra cost. This allows the hi fi rack to fit around your system, and means you can keep adapting and upgrading your rack with extra tiers and/or longer legs as you add in more equipment.</p><p>Each leg comes with a 10mm thick, high tensile steel connection rod and isolating spiked feet, available in a choice of black or stainless steel, so you can isolate each tier from the next.</p>'
