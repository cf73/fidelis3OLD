description: '<p><strong>CDP Features</strong></p><p>The Saturn-<em>R</em>&nbsp;uses our proven digital to analogue converter and analogue output amplifier technology coupled with a pair of Wolfson WM8742 digital to analogue converter IC’s. The Saturn-<em>R</em>&nbsp;has improvements to the CD section power supply which was a result of the research &amp; development of our reference Isis CD player along with the improved micro-controller and display drivers.</p><p><strong>Technology</strong></p><p>The Saturn-<em>R</em>&nbsp;uses a high stability master clock and high capacity power supply in the CD circuitry, high performance PLL digital interface receiver, isolated digital inputs and high performance power supply architecture in the DAC circuitry. Signal switching between the CD and DAC functions are performed in the digital to analogue converter stage. The signal path of the CD section in CD mode is kept to a minimum.</p><p><strong>USB 192kHz-24bits asynchronous</strong></p><p>The DAC USB input has been improved with asynchronous operation at sample rates of 44.1 to 192kHz with a bit rate of up to 24 bits. The USB input has the same galvanic isolation as used in the Rega DAC-<em>R</em>. The USB uses dedicated drivers in the computer, enabling full ASIO operation, thus eliminating signal degradation caused by generic windows based drivers.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>And how does it sound? In a word – Glorious! To describe the sound in terms of bass, mid-range and treble would be sacrilege. It would be similar to describing a Salvador Dali painting in terms of structure. It’s not perfunctorily structured; it flows, bends reality and lures your eyes across the face of the image.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
