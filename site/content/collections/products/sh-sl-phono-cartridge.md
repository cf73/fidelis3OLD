    excerpt: '<h3>"Very Involving and Refined"</h3><p>Distinguished by their black body, the Hana SL and SH moving coil phono cartridges provide tighter channel balance, greater channel separation, and improved high-frequency extension compared to their EH and EL counterparts. The SL and SH models also feature an upgraded Shibata stylus.&nbsp;</p><h4>"A No Brainer"</h4><p>The Hana SL won the coveted "Recommended" honors from England''s&nbsp;<i>Hi-Fi Choice</i>&nbsp;magazine. According to Neville Roberts, "The Hana-SL gives a really sophisticated performance, which is very involving and refined… Both (Hana-SL &amp; Hana-SH) are superb cartridges and are strong challengers to rival big-name brands at the price."&nbsp;</p><p>"I really liked these cartridges as they were fuss free and just got on with their job of producing great music," notes&nbsp;<i>HifiPig.com</i>. "The low output for me was better but this doesn’t mean the high output was poor or wouldn’t be preferred by some listeners. If you only have a moving magnet input on your amp or pre amp then the high output version is a no brainer."&nbsp;</p><h4>Chose Low Output or High Output Versions</h4><p>The SL cartridge is the low output version, while the SH is the high output version. SL has an output voltage of 0.5mV, and the SH has an output voltage of 2.0mV.&nbsp;</p><p>Hana cartridges use the best materials, including alnico magnets, cross-shaped armatures, and proprietary manufacturing processes. Hana has excelled at creating MC cartridges noted worldwide for their sound and value, which retain their ''musical magic'' regardless of their phono stage pairing.</p>'
