description: '<p>The S4 Series draws inspiration from decades of production results achieved by historical Series. Thanks to the priority assigned on the qualitative research dedicated over the years to the ideal materials, all the main characteristics of the previous products - made by welding processes - have merged with the most valuable technical properties improved over the years through the development of Hyperspike line. It born in this way a basilar range of equipments mainly characterized by the excellence, quality and simplicity of its components. The refined and basilar style of the discontinued 7 Series is unmistakably present in the new S4 Series, which is always the result of our passion for music. The need of offering a line of supports further extended in width and with the same dimensional characteristics between the levels of the S3â€™s shelves, has led to the creation of a superlative and efficient line of products that can be also alternative to the most prestigious HW Hyperspike Series, at very affordable prices. On the wake, then, of the technical properties typical of the S3 Series, the S4 Series presents itself as a congenial solution both in terms of functional efficiency and of space management, without losing any aesthetic care for your ideal spaces.</p>'
