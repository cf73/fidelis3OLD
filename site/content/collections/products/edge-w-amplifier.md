description: '<p>For all its power, Edge W is remarkably detailed. The sound is finely balanced, with a musical depth and clarity that comes through with every note. It’s all down to how we chose the componentry inside – nothing was picked on price, specs or measured performance. We listened carefully. And created our system with components that simply sounded the best. The end result is a power amplifier that truly brings an original recording to life like no other. Although minimal in its exterior design, Edge W has some complex audio engineering inside. To remove the barriers between you and your music, we have worked hard to minimize the number of components in the signal path. As a result, Edge W delivers a more faithful reproduction of the original recording; an impressively detailed three-dimensional sound, with striking staging and focus.&nbsp; We pioneered the use of toroidal transformers in amplifiers, which led to improved performance. In Edge we take this one step further, using opposing symmetry twin toroidal transformers. This cancels out electromagnetic interference whilst offering outstanding power and maintaining consistent tonality, no matter how loud it’s played. Using standard Class A amplifier technology wasn’t going to be efficient enough for Edge W. Instead we added a bias voltage to a traditional Class AB design, reducing distortion to inaudible levels. This unique configuration also produces less heat and makes the whole system much more effective.&nbsp;</p>'
