  <h3>Seven-Day Return Guarantee</h3><p>Unless
  otherwise specified, you may return any item purchased at Fidelis within 7
  days, provided that the item is in like-new condition with blank warranty cards, all
  boxes and packing, manuals and original sales receipt, for store credit only.
  Special order items are excluded. Used items are excluded from this policy and are considered "final sales".&nbsp;</p><h3>One Year Trade-Up Policy</h3><p>Loudspeaker

  turntables purchased new at Fidelis may be traded in for like items, costing at
  least twice as much as the original unit. 100% of the original price may be
  applied as long as the unit retains original packing, boxes, instructions and
  proof of purchase. The unit traded in must be in excellent working order and
  without cosmetic defects. This policy excludes phono cartridges or other items that are subject to usage-related wear and performance deterioration.</p><h3>Equipment Loaned for Home Trial Use</h3><p>Fidelis
  may, at its sole discretion, loan certain demo equipment to local customers for
  limited home use. There may be a per diem charge for the use of such equipment
