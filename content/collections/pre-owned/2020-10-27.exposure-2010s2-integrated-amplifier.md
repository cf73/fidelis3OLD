description: '<p>Exposure 2010S2 Integrated Amplifier in very good condition - silver finish.&nbsp;</p><p>The new 2010S2 entry level series builds on Exposure''s highly acclaimed 2010S products. The 2010S2 integrated amplifier now utilizes relay switching. This significant change yields a substantial improvement in transparency over the previous version''s mechanical switching. A cleaner signal path in the 2010S2 power amplifier results in better sound quality.</p><p>The 2010S2 Integrated Amplifier also features a high-capacity, 200VA custom-made toroidal power transformer and power supply capacitors as well as improved all-aluminum casework and extruded front panel to control resonance and stray electro-magnetic fields. High quality capacitors used in the signal path. There is a uniquely tuned short signal and power supply path PCB. Cascode circuitry is utilized for improved power supply immunity. Sanken bipolar output transistors are used for dynamic and performance. There is separate pre-amp output with Class A buffer stage. The 2010S2 is Bi-wiring compatible. Power output is 75 watts per channel into 8 ohms. Comes with remote control.</p><p><strong>Power Output:&nbsp;</strong>75 Watts per channel RMS 8 ohms<strong><br>Input Sensitivity:&nbsp;</strong>250mV<strong><br>Input Impedance:&nbsp;</strong>&gt;14K ohms, line input<strong><br>Pre-amplifier Output:&nbsp;</strong>gain + 18dB<strong><br>Frequency Response:&nbsp;</strong>20Hz – 20 KHz ± 0.5dB<br><strong>Total Harmonic Distortion:&nbsp;</strong>&lt;0.05% at 1KHz, rated power<br><strong>Channel Separation:&nbsp;</strong>20Hz-20KHz, &gt;60dB<br><strong>Mains Supply:&nbsp;</strong>110/120V or 220/240V, 50/60Hz (factory set)<br><strong>Max Power Consumption:&nbsp;</strong>200VA (both channels driven, 8 Ohm load)<br><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>(H x W x D): 90mm x 440mm x 310mm<br><strong>Net Weight (unpacked):&nbsp;</strong>15.4 lbs.<br><strong>Gross Weight (packed):&nbsp;</strong>19.8 lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
