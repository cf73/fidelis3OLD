description: '<p>The&nbsp;Hana EH&nbsp;high-output&nbsp;moving coil cartridge represents the best way to upgrade from “starter”&nbsp;MM&nbsp;cartridges that typically come packaged with&nbsp;most entry-level&nbsp;turntables. Weighing in at only 5 grams, and possessing great tracking ability, the Hana EH&nbsp;cartridge’s&nbsp;distinctive moss green body houses a&nbsp;special&nbsp;cross-coil&nbsp;generator, reproducing great bass and dynamics.&nbsp;The&nbsp;elliptical stylus&nbsp;mounted to&nbsp;an aluminum cantilever&nbsp;easily extracts the music in the groove as it effortlessly traces you LPs.</p><p>The EH is plug-and-play compatible with MM phono stages found in integrated amplifiers and AV receivers.&nbsp;</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>&nbsp;The Hana seemed completely compatible with every record I played.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of surface noise even made my older worn records sound great.&nbsp; The music comes through in a three dimensional presentation giving the “you are there” experience”.</p>'
