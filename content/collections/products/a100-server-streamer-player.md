    excerpt: '<p>The Aurender A100 is a computer that''s purpose-built to be a music server optimized specifically for music reproduction in tandem with its robust operating software. I found the A100 to be a significant step up from using a computer designed for multiple purposes and trying to adapt it for music server duty. The A100 is better at reproducing music both from a performance standpoint and from a user interface perspective. Music played through the Aurender A100 does an admirable job at providing enough musical detail to satisfy most music enthusiasts, while still leaning slightly toward the warm side, making it enjoyable for longer listening sessions.</p>'
