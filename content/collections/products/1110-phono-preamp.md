description: '<p>What is it that makes the 1110 Stereo preamplifier so special? It is something rare, an overachiever, a&nbsp;unique combination of reference-level performance and compact, convenient design. It is at once familiar in size and shape and yet completely new in aesthetic design detail. Perhaps what makes it so special is that it takes such amazing sight, sound, use, and feel and packs them all into a single chassis. It is the perfect mix of traditional function and cutting-edge technology, earning more than 10 international product awards from media around the world.</p><p>It is, after all, a Boulder, and every Boulder is special.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>Remember the old saying “straight wire with gain”? It seems that Boulder is closer to that “truth” than others. There’s nothing like taking the same record from deck to deck to hear the fundamental differences of each. The elements which make that possible and so easily identifiable are the Boulder 1100 and 1160 combo. Straight shooters, definitely an end game sort of setup. A+++</p>'
