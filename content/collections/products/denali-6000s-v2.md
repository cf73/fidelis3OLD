quote: 'The Denali D6000/S v2 may be tucked into the middle of Shunyata Research’s current product lineup, but it’s a true reference-level power conditioner without a true reference-level price. It gets my vote for Caelin Gabriel’s best product yet.'

description: '<p>Over the past 25 years Shunyata Research has earned a reputation for producing the highest-performance power-distribution systems on the market.&nbsp; Whether providing clean power for James Guthrie’s re-master of&nbsp;<em>Dark Side Of The Moon</em>, or unearthing never-before-seen signal resolution in heart surgery systems, Shunyata Research’s results have been consistently transformational.&nbsp; With unequivocal critical and professional acclaim as a back drop, Shunyata designer Caelin Gabriel set out to produce a truly reference power conditioner that set new standards in performance but at a price that every audiophile could afford.</p><p>The Denali 6000/S v2 adds measurably improved performance and technology to a design that had already won multiple Product of the Year Awards and raves from every critic that reviewed it. Design advances within Denali v2 include objectively lowered noise, double the outlet zone-isolation and superior high-current performance for amps and other high-current electronics on all outlets.</p><p>The Denali 6000/S is designed to provide the finest performance available, at a price-point intended to embarrass the competition.</p>'
