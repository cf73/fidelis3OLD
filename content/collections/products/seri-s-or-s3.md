quote: 'Although it can happily shake the walls every bit as much as its R328 predecessor, this is also a subtle and deft device. The curious thing about the REL S/3 is its lack of impressiveness is what will impress you most. This subwoofer has little or no character to speak of and will interact with the fastest of loudspeakers with ease. You’ll hardly notice it is there, until you turn it off. Then, it’s like someone deflated your loudspeakers. Outstanding.'

description: '<p><strong>Power and Performance</strong><br>The Beautifully Balanced S/3<br>S/3 derives from the flagship S/5 and offers a more compact footprint and much of S/5 performance for use with either slightly more modest systems or rooms that cannot handle the power and output of S/5. Qualitatively, it is the equal of S/5, sans the grand scale, power and majesty of its larger sibling.</p><p>Beautifully balanced, S/3 offers powerful, incisive and beautifully balanced performance.</p><p>S/3 uses a special carbon/carbon passive that is stiff, lightweight and incredibly well-behaved. Our approach to passive design results in performance more akin to a variable ratio driver size. On an S/3, think of it as a sliding ratio design wherein the S/3 begins as an ultra-fast 10‚Äù sealed box design and, as more power and deeper bass is demanded S/3 gradually morphs into the power and output of a 15″ design.</p><p>S/3’s power amplifier is a powerful NextGen2 400W digital amplifier. This design has powered thousands of RELs and has proven exceptionally reliable and very fast with deep, extended lows‚Äîit provides a perfect mate to our new driver.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>It may seem like a paradox, but the way to get good sound out of a subwoofer (for music use, at least) is to try to get almost no sound out of the subwoofer at all. Most stereo systems do not have an LFE/subwoofer line level output, but even if the system does include a line-level out for a subwoofer, REL recommends that for musical use, one is best served by connecting the subwoofer to the loudspeaker terminals (the REL takes a wired or wireless feed from the left and right positive and one negative speaker terminals at the amplifier). Then, reduce the output of the subwoofer until it becomes all but inaudible, and merely provides additional bass reinforcement below the limits of the loudspeakers. The process is more complex in the real world, but the important factor is the subwoofer should be ‘sub’; that is, it should play at a level and a frequency below the main loudspeakers, and subservient to their output.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>'
