quote: 'As if it had been hewn from the very rock face of a large mountain, the Storm Mk.II is strong, solid, heavy, massy and meaty. As you might expect, it applies those elements to the music it plays, producing control, authority and a dominance over each and every frequency. Detail is honed and exact with a precision that is impressive and a focus that is a standard that others will only dream about.'

    excerpt: '<p>"The Storm Mk.II showed its low end abilities admirably with bass being an ever present, adding further solidity to the soundstage, producing a massy thrust to bass and a weight to guitars with percussion adding punch but also plenty of tonal variety as each drum type was hit during a mini solo sequence."</p>'
