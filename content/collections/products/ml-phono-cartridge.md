description: '<p>Building upon the foundation of the critically acclaimed HANA sound, the ML aspires toward affordable perfection and represent the further evolution of the “Brilliant and Gorgeous” quality that has earned HANA its worldwide reputation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>M Series Nude Microline stylus – Higher Specification Part&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Befitting its name, the M Series uses a Nude Microline stylus, mimicking the cutting stylus and fitting more precisely into the vinyl groove. This enhances tracking to capture the most delicate musical details with better frequency reproduction, stereo imaging, and resolution.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>High Purity copper wire – Higher Specification Part&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Very high-purity copper wire is used for winding the ML coil with a new low impedance generator for optimized performance with a broader range of phono preamps&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Delrin© cartridge body – Advanced Materials&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The M Series cartridge body is injection molded from Delrin©, a high-tech polymer with improved mechanical characteristics for better resonance damping, to reveal more low level information and enhance dynamic range.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cryogenic Processing - Unique Technical Treatment</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Cryogenic processing is Cold Annealing at near absolute zero temperature that restructures metals at the molecular level, especially important in the Alnico based magnetic electro-motive circuit (cartridge signal generator). The M Series parts treated include the front yoke as well as center and rear components. The result is a more precise and controlled magnetic flux field for greater linearity and musical sound quality.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brass Cap with Threaded fittings - Superior Mechanical Interface&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Delrin© cartridge body features an integral machined brass cap providing constrained mode layer damping and its heavier 9.5 gram weight provides expanded compatibility with a wider range of tonearms and turntables.&nbsp;</p><p>Built into the M Series Delrin© cartridge body are metal threaded fittings for headshell mounting hardware, offering easier attachment and a superior mechanical interface for better bass and dynamics.</p><p><br></p>'
