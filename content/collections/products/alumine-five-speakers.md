    excerpt: '<p>What the Alumine Five represents is a potent blend of weight, dynamic impact, tonal and rhythmic subtlety, in a beautifully executed and integrated package. For listeners who value the sense and feeling of sharing space with real, breathing musicians, that’s an awful lot of performance from an apparently simple-looking box, a box that’s easy to work with and easy to match. If I were looking at speakers in this price range, the Alumine Five would absolutely demand my attention.</p>'
