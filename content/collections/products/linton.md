quote: 'Which brings us full circle. That’s what makes the Wharfdale Lintons really rock, and so much fun to build a system around. These are speakers that you can get lost in for hours upon end just listening to music, and that’s what it’s all about.'

description: '<p>To celebrate its history, Wharfedale has established the Heritage Series recreations of famous models from its past, entirely re-engineered using contemporary techniques and materials. The latest loudspeaker to join this collection is the Linton.</p><p>The original Linton debuted in 1965 and the line continued in various iterations until the end of the 1970s. It was a classic model of its time, viewed as a serious hi-ﬁ speaker but also relatively aﬀordable. Its cabinet was substantial, big enough to hold three drive units including a good-sized bass unit, yet not overly unwieldy by the standards of the day.</p><p>The new Linton has a clear family resemblance. It, too, is a three-way standmount model – a rarity in the modern era – retaining similar proportions to the classic Linton models. Its wood-veneered cabinet has a vintage look, yet the standard of ﬁnish is distinctly contemporary.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>The Wharfedale Linton''s merge a refined, elegantly detailed, full-range sound with a magnetic personality that made me&nbsp;<i>want</i>&nbsp;to play records—made me want to listen longer, and to understand more of what I was listening to. These conspicuous talents, plus the fact that the Linton''s look Jaguar-like expensive and cost less than they should, make the newest Wharfedale''s highly recommendable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
