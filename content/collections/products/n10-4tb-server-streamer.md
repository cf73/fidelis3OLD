description: '<p>When computer audio first started to gain popularity, USB was the de facto standard for the digital audio signal transport. This was simply because computers have USB ports, not AES/EBU or other SPDIF ports. Unfortunately, USB can be a flawed protocol for digital audio transmission as it is prone to noise, jitter, and compatibility issues. Done properly, AES/EBU and SPDIF audio outputs represent a superior method of audio transmission with nearly universal compatibility, less jitter, and greater ease and flow to the overall musical presentation.&nbsp;N10 represents the state-of-the art of these protocols with its OCXO controlled SPDIF outputs – use them and discover a higher standard than USB.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>Utilizing the Aurender N10 Music Server in comparison to laptop-based computer audio playback opened my eyes yet again to what audio design focused on noise elimination form the circuit path is capable of accomplishing. The more resolving your DAC is, the more resolving your system is, the more you will get out of adding the N10 to your mix and the more thought provoking and engaging your listening sessions will be.</p>'
