description: '<p>Swiss state of the art design and aesthetic sensibilities pervade the clean and elegant aluminum cabinet. Never before has<br>design and fidelity conspired to yield such ethereal yet tangible results.</p><p>For instance, the two 13 inches drivers are proprietary multilayer cone with very long linear excursion, mated to extremely<br>powerful magnets, resulting in dynamic, impact and deep foundation.</p><p>The solid and massive aluminum case, combined with an exclusive central mechanical coupling system, allows the<br>Alumine SUB to reach the lowest frequencies with power, authority and particularly low distortion.</p><p>The Alumine SUB expand the capabilities of all speakers of our Alumine range : TWO, THREE, FIVE and MOVIE.</p><p><br></p>'
