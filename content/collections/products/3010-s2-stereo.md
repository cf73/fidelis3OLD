    excerpt: '<p>The Exposure 3010S2 amplifier treats tough loads with disdain.</p><p>I was struck by the feeling this would be a special ride. Right out of the box, the amp sparkled with a vitality that elicited a smile from me. The longer I listened, the more I was convinced that Exposure had made a mistake in the pricing, but this was not the case (<em>too cheap</em>).</p><p>This amp excelled at pace, rhythm and timing, possessing an abundance of slam right down to the low frequencies, with an essentially neutral texture right up to the higher ranges. Depending on the wiring used, the treble could sound crisp or darker, and vocals either projected well out from the sound stage or sat languidly in the mix. The amp wasn’t adding much, even as the proverbial “toe-tapping” quality was made clear from the very first moments.</p>'
