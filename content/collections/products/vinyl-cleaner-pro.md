    excerpt: '<p>And wow, is that suction feature&nbsp;<i>quiet</i>! To give you an idea of how quiet the Nessie is, I had to walk the length of my listening room, down a hall and turn a corner into the middle of my home office, a distance of more than 60 feet (20m) before the VPI 16 measured as quiet as the Nessie. My wife was equally impressed when she heard the Nessie in action. The words in the cartoon bubble above her head read: "<i>Buy this!</i></p>'
