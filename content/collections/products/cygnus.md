description: '<p>In an industry where hyperbole reigns supreme, and additional money spent often has little correlation to improved performance, the Cygnus is truly an uncommon loudspeaker.&nbsp;</p><p>Maintaining the iconic Rockport form, the Cygnus embodies all of the attributes that the Avior II and Atria II are known for, yet brings each of these elements to an even higher performance level. The result is a loudspeaker which, like its siblings, transcends the boundaries of technical excellence and enters the realm of actually making music.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cygnus’ beryllium tweeter is mounted into a custom, machined aluminum waveguide which improves the acoustic impedance match of the tweeter at the low end of its range, allowing for lower distortion and greater dynamic expression from the tweeter itself, and improved dispersion characteristics at the midrange/tweeter crossover point. Numerous prototype waveguides were modeled and manufactured using the stereolithography process until the optimum waveguide profile was achieved. The waveguide is precision diamond-machined and then anodized, rendering a beautiful 3-D luster, and providing an ideal mounting surface for the tweeter.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cygnus loudspeaker benefits from our latest generation midrange, and uses Rockport’s state-of-the-art, variable section thickness, carbon fiber sandwich composite cone matched to our enormously powerful, ultra-low distortion motor system. With a usable bandwidth of nearly 6 octaves, distortion figures lower than some amplifiers (-60 dB!), as well as linear excursion that rivals many midbass drivers, the midrange reproduction of the Cygnus is groundbreaking. When matched to our new waveguide mounted beryllium tweeter, the Cygnus midrange is extraordinarily resolved, textured, and dynamically engaging, and presents music with a coherency so natural it’s uncanny.&nbsp;</p><p>Genuine, first octave extension is delivered via two, all new, custom designed and built 10″ carbon fiber/sandwich composite woofers per channel. The woofer’s massive 3″ diameter motor system provides enormous thermal and mechanical headroom and also exhibits the same vanishingly low distortion figures as our midrange driver (-60 dB!). With 50% greater surface area than the Avior’s twin woofers, the extension, ease, and resolution of the Cygnus’ bass registers is world class by any standard, especially given the enclosure’s modest proportions.</p>'
