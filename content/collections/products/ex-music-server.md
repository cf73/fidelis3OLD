description: '<p>The small form factor Antipodes S30 is our entry-level music server and yet it is based on the advanced player engine used in the K50 and K30. The only compromise made is the external power supply brick supplied as standard. But audio performance can be dramatically enhanced by adding the HSL50-based S60 power supply. With or without the S60, the audio performance of the S30 is outstanding at the respective price points.</p><p>The Antipodes S30 is medium-power, enabling it to handle all Server Apps and Player Apps, but audiophiles wanting to use heavy DSP features should consider the high-power S40.</p><p>The Antipodes S30 is recommended for use as:</p><ul><li>A medium-power Server/Player, running both Server Apps and Player Apps, or</li><li>A dedicated Player-only, receiving a music stream by Ethernet from a high quality music server like the Antipodes K40 or S40.</li></ul><p>The Antipodes S30 includes an internal DAC with analog RCA outputs for convenience and ease of use. The analog sound is very detailed and musical, and it provides an elegant solution for someone who does not have a separate high-end DAC. However a high-end DAC can be plugged into the S30 USB port to enhance the outcome to an even higher level.</p><p>Install your own storage disk, up to 5TB HDD or 8TB SSD, or have your provider install it for you. Add USB drives. Include music files located elsewhere on your network. Upload music files from anywhere on your network. Add internet streaming services. Attach an Antipodes K10 Ripper to import music from your CDs. All easily user-configurable to form a single integrated music library that is available to all playback solutions selected.</p><p>Easily select the playback solutions you wish to use, from the world''s best high-end digital audio software providers. Play via USB Audio or Analog to your main stereo system, and at the same time stream over your network to streaming devices.</p><p>Setup and control everything from your desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone.</p><p><br></p>'

    excerpt: '<p>&nbsp;However, used as a purely digital source this ''Music Server'' is both a fine example of its kind and a hint of what may be possible when we come to test a complete CX/EX combination. Use it as ''transport'' for a USB DAC and you''re unlikely to be disappointed.</p><p><br><br></p>'
