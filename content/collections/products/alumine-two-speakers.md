quote: 'What sets the Stenheim speakers apart from so much of the competition is the choice of drivers. In stark contrast to the much-trumpeted high-tech units employed by the likes of Magico and YG, Stenheim pair their precision-crafted cabinets with drive units that are most kindly described as traditional but might as easily be lambasted as plain old-fashioned by those advocates of metal, carbon, ceramic or diamond diaphragms. Yet it’s this mix of modern cabinet materials and long-established driver technologies that makes the Alumine Two so fascinating -- and arguably so successful.'

description: '<p>With high efficiency, the Alumine permits the use of high quality but lower powered amplifiers. Unparalleled speed combined with beautiful and rich tone elevates STENHEIM from all too common audiophile fireworks and overhyped, but ultimately fatiguing designs.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>If you need a compact speaker that allows your music to breathe, that’s big on expression, big on intimacy and big communication but isn’t phased by big or loud, then the Alumine Two could be just what you’re looking for. Other brands might make more noise about (and with) their aluminum boxes, but right now it’s the Stenheims that are delivering the musical goods.</p>'
