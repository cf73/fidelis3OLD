    excerpt: '<p>And that’s where our comment about it being a modern product for a new hi-fi world comes in. The once humble digital to analogue converter is becoming a ubiquitous and increasingly vital hi-fi component.</p><p>And if you’ve already got a good DAC, we would not hesitate to recommend the Cambridge CXC over a standalone CD player to link to it. You’ll have to spend a good deal more than £300 to match the sound quality it offers</p>'
