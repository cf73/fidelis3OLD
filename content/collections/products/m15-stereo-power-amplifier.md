description: '<p>The Bricasti M15 stereo amplifier is the beating heart of any system and in particular, a Bricasti Design system. Like its bigger mono-block brother the M28, the M15 delivers heaps of power at critical stages, forging a sonic path of least resistance all the way from source to the speaker. This can be heard and felt and is in part thanks to its fully differential / balanced architecture.</p>'
