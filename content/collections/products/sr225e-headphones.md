description: '<p>This headphone has&nbsp;sizable rear air flow through a metal screen, while utilizing Grado''s larger ear cushion and&nbsp;closely matched drivers.&nbsp;The result is a broad soundstage&nbsp;free from colorations. The way the SR225e''s new driver, cable and plastic housing move air and react to sound vibrations&nbsp;is virtually unaffected by transient distortions. Bass, midrange and treble are all more&nbsp;wide open and you will enjoy the fine tonal spread and balance. The SR225e will produce a sound that is pure Grado, with warm harmonic colors, rich full bodied vocals, excellent dynamics, and an ultra-smooth top end.</p>'
