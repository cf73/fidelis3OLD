description: '<p>It has arrived! We are very excited to share the All New S202 Stereo Amplifier with you! Further details will be coming.</p><p>After&nbsp; the astounding success and performance of the S500 Stereo Amplifier, we set our sights on expanding that sound to more systems. Trickle-down technologies incorporated into a more compact, lower-power framework resulted in the S202. It’s capable of meeting our DAC’s ultra high dynamic range head-on with optimized architecture in the critical areas of audio performance, power supplies, and ultra low-noise design. The S202 includes a fully modular design, matched impedance input stage and an all billet CNC case. The highest value amplifier we’ve ever created, the S202 redefines excellence and sets a new bar in the industry.</p><p>-200 Watt Rating<br>-Trickle-down technology from the S500 Stereo Amplifier<br>-Zero Negative Feedback<br>-Class A input stage<br>-Class A/B output stage<br>-Independent Input Stage and Output Stage power supplies<br>-Shielded Transformers<br>-Modular Core Design<br>-Fully differential balanced design<br>-Made in the U.S.A.</p>'
