description: '<p>The Model 1Ci is living proof that designing and building a great entry-level speaker doesn''t require as much ingenuity and skill as a cost-no-object flagship- it requires even more! The Model 1Ci is a time- and phase-correct speaker constructed in such a way that the alignment and positioning of the drivers allow a point-source wave front and maximize the phase coherence of the loudspeaker at the listening position. Dimensional Purity in a shockingly affordable full-range speaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'

    excerpt: |
      <p>We are very pleased to
      award the Vandersteen 1Ci
      one of our Exceptional Value
      Awards for 2014. These
      speakers are so enjoyable
      that, if your high-end journey
      stopped right here, you’d
      be a pretty happy human
      being. Even if you are a highly
      experienced audiophile and
      you haven’t heard these, you
      owe it to yourself to check
      them out. I guarantee you’ll be
      very surprised for the better.
      They redefine what is possible
      for a modest price.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
