quote: 'I hate to tell you, but there is indeed a correlation between price and performance. Can you spend a lot less and still hear music? You already know the answer. As for me, could I settle for less musical verity? The answer is hell no! I would never stop wondering. Like the Peggy Lee song, "Is that all there is". The Double X is the vehicle to bring all the escapist enjoyment your musical heart desires. It is made with all the Teutonic precision that allows Mega Cartridges of any price to perform for you.'

description: '<p>We at Acoustic Signature built excellent turntables – real mechanical masterpieces – for more than 20 years now. The DOUBLE X was designed to offer a product to music lovers looking for a more classic and traditional design. The used wooden veneer is covered with a 10 layer piano finish.</p><p>Beside this elegant look the DOUBLE X is full of modern technologies and idea´s. It comes with a sandwich design of the plinth made from steel and Aluminum and wood. This clever arranged sandwich results in high internal damping and great sonic performance. It‘s all combined with the award-winning performance, elegance, convenience and comfort that have made our mass turntable Series so successful all over the world.</p><p>At the new DOUBLE X we combine a massive sandwich plinth of 60mm with a 50mm massive Aluminum platter. The sandwich is made by using laser cutting and fl exible glue.</p><p>The DOUBLE X comes with a precisely manufactured 11kg Aluminum platter. The platter is additionally coated on the back side with a high damping material to get great results. An 8 Silencer platter is part of the DOUBLE X design. We at Acoustic Signature believe that a motor system for a turntable should have enough energy to speed up the platter but not influence him during rotation. We reach that aim by using a precision DC motor with a internal speed control.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>It is no coincidence that in this test I focused on albums whose most important element is the vocal. It is because the Double X shows vocals in an amazing way,&nbsp;<b>differentiating, swinging and highlighting strong saturation of the midrange.</b>&nbsp;It has quite low bass, although its midrange is not as well-defined as in more expensive turntables produced by the company. The treble is sweet and a little warm – but this is what the turntable sounds like. It has wonderful dynamics and also nicely plays old rock and classical music.</p>'
