    type: Review
    excerpt: '<p>Vivid''s Kaya 45 speakers exceeded the expectations raised by their heritage and impressive show previews. Sure, some speakers can play louder and go deeper, but one must pay one price or another for that privilege: larger size, higher cost, or less beauty. The Kayas sounded good from the moment they hit the carpet, and better after I toed them in toward the listening position. They never failed to please, with any musical source at any reasonable listening level. (Perhaps they really&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;Shmoos!) The Kaya 45s are among a handful of speakers that I will miss after they are gone. You should not miss auditioning them.</p>'
