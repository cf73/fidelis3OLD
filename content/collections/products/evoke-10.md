    excerpt: '<h4>"The Ultimate Reference in This Price Category"</h4><p>Plug them in, turn them up, and then invite a friend to hear them. We won''t be surprised he your friend asks where the rest of the speakers are. That’s when you smile, shrug and invite them to sit down in the sweet-spot on your sofa. And then turn it up a bit more and enjoy the look of surprise</p>'
