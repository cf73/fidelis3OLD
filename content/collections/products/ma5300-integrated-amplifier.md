Powerful new control microprocessors have been used to improve overall system operation, along with some of the latest audio-grade circuit components to deliver the best possible sound. Bass and treble tone controls have been added to help you further fine tune your music to your personal preferences.'
description: '<p><a href="https://www.mcintoshlabs.com/brand/news/MA5300-Stereo-plus"></a>&nbsp;<br>The MA5300 Integrated Amplifier is proof that big sound can come in small packages. It is our smallest solid state integrated amplifier in terms of both power output and physical size, making it an ideal choice for smaller spaces or for someone just beginning to assemble a home audio system. It’s a direct coupled amplifier that delivers 100 Watts per channel into 8 Ohm&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcintoshlabs.com/products/speakers">speakers</a>&nbsp;or 160 Watts per channel into 4 Ohm speakers. New dual scale blue Watt meters give an accurate readout of power output for both 4 and 8 Ohm impedances.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>Nothing is lost and nothing is added passing through this MA5300 amplifier. In actuality it functions like a central switch board becoming a faithful conduit of the music from the source. If I were to begin building (once again) a highly accurate laboratory reference audio system. I would base everything on the corner stone that is the McIntosh 5300 Integrated amplifier. It is the McIntosh Labs reputation carried forward, the build quality and performance is exemplary! Considering the range of prices of modern high-end audio amplifiers, it is not expensive at $5000. Almost a bargain, actually, all things are considered. I know the phrase highly recommended has been totally worn out to death, but it still is true, go and listen to the McIntosh MA5300 integrated amplifier with phono stage, and you''ll probably find yourself extremely happy.</p>'
