quote: 'My thoughts on value are even more concise. As with other Rega products—their entry-level tonearms come to mind—few other audio components of my experience, and no other contemporary CD players, offer so much music for so little money.'

description: '<p><strong>Analogue &amp; digital outputs</strong><br>Development of the analogue, digital and control domains ensured direct improvements of both analogue and digital outputs making the Apollo&nbsp;&nbsp;a perfect partner for the Rega Brio&nbsp;amplifier and an ideal ‘CD format’ front-end for the Rega DAC.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Compact case design</strong><br>The Apollo is housed in our latest custom half-width case to match the Brio amplifier.<br>The top loading mechanism offers ease of use and unrivaled reliability.</p><p><strong>Digital to analogue conversion</strong><br>The output amplifier of the Apollo uses the high specification&nbsp;Wolfson WM8742 digital to analogue converter, the same integrated circuit found in the multi-award winning&nbsp;Rega DAC''s.</p><p><strong>Power supplies</strong><br>The Apollo uses&nbsp;‘digital’ power supplies feeding the CD processor, optical block and&nbsp;laser diode amplifier.<br>This is achieved by using the same high performance, low noise power supplies found in the same location within the Rega&nbsp;reference&nbsp;CD player. This vastly improves the playability, error correction and the ‘inner core’ processing of the digital CD ‘spinner’ part of the Apollo.</p><p><strong>Output amplifier</strong><br>The discrete output amplifier has a THD&nbsp;of 0.0025%, whilst at the same time improving the overall sound quality of the output amplifier.</p><p><strong>User interface</strong><br>The user interface is controlled by using a dedicated display micro-processor, which eases the workload on the main control processors giving an improvement in the control code stability, usability and improved speed of initialisation of the disc being played.</p><p><strong>Dedicated CD mini system remote control</strong><br>A new dedicated CD remote handset is supplied as standard which also has the advantage of&nbsp;Rega&nbsp;amplifier functionality.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>Forced to sum up the Rega Apollo''s sound in a sentence or two, I would write: This player has a sonic brilliance—a clarity of detail and of musical line, allied with a spatially up-front presentation—that enhances musical engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
