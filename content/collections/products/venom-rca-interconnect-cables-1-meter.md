description: '<p>Venom Interconnects are available in various lengths as ordered. They are also available for Balanced Interconnects. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>VTX-Ag</strong>&nbsp;cables are uniquely constructed with both an inner, center conductor made of pure silver and an outer concentric ring conductor made of pure copper.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is made using the finest fluorocarbon insulation to minimize dielectric absorption and re-radiation which translates to an improvement in resolution and clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;VTX-Ag delivers the speed and clarity of silver and the midrange warmth and three dimensional power in the lower octaves of copper without imparting any of the negatives associated with either metal.</p><p><i>— The best qualities of silver and copper combined.</i></p><p>‌<strong>Ohno</strong>&nbsp;wire, also called ‌PCOCC was invented in 1986 by professor Atsumi ‌Ohno of the Chiba Institute of Technology in Japan. Copper wire is created by an extrusion process that pulls a rod of cold copper through a small orifice which creates multiple crystalline boundaries. By contrast, ‌‌Ohno wire is made by a process using heated molds that cast a wire to form a single crystalline structure. ‌‌Ohno wire is well known for its exceptionally pure, grain-free sonic qualities.</p>'
