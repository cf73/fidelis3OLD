quote: 'The Acoustic Signature Invictus turntable and TA-9000 tonearm. Simply put, this ultra-expensive bit of Teutonic engineering is the best record player (by far) that I have heard in my home. And the difference between it and other rivals isn’t trivial or a matter of nuance.'

    excerpt: '<p>Not too long ago TAS’ Paul Seydor reported that the TechDAS Air Force One turntable with Graham Phantom Elite tonearm produced a sound from LPs that was “not likely to be surpassed in our lifetime.” Well…beep, beep! Here comes a potential surpasser—and, checking my pulse, I think it’s still my lifetime. This incredibly massive (375 pounds of CNC-milled aluminum and brass, not including its 400-pound stand), six-motor, belt-driven, almost Mayan-looking&nbsp;<em>objet du son</em>&nbsp;from Gunther Frohnhoefer of Germany is not only the biggest, heaviest, and most imperturbable record player I have ever come across--you simply cannot make it feed back vibration, even by pounding on it with both hands while it is playing--it is also the most versatile (it accepts four tonearms) and the simplest to use (at least, once you’ve hoisted it onto a suitable support system).&nbsp;<em>Unbelievably</em>&nbsp;quiet in playback, in combination with the TA-9000 tonearm it tracks with the precision of a Westrex cutterhead, reproducing instruments and vocals with unparalleled three-dimensionality, solidity, color, detail, power, pace—all those good things—and turning the soundstage into a veritable diorama of a symphony orchestra, a string quartet, a jazz quintet, or a rock trio.</p>'
