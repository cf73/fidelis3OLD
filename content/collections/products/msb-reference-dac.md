description: '<p>With four Hybrid DACs, we yield an unmatched level of detail, reproducing the musicality, soundstage, and texture of an original performance, bringing the artist to you. A fully balanced, ultra-high precision, discrete ladder DAC architecture ensures each note tells a story. Additionally, MSB’s robust in-house design enables the finest quality playback of PCM and native DSD, while our low impedance circuitry drives your amplification directly without adding coloration or buffering noise. The end result is a digital experience defying expectations.</p><p>Smooth chassis lines. Few controls. Focused modularity. High-end quality. As we set out to create a new level of digital-to-analog conversion, our design statement ensured the best usability and quality. The resulting product has set a new, previously undiscovered reference in the listening experience.</p><p>Equipped with high-visibility and a wide viewing angle, the display is both easy-to-read and stunning, exhibiting our love for intuitive features. &nbsp;The LED display, slaved to the audio clock, is refreshed between data processing to drastically reduce electrical interference. The in-house discrete design is then constructed into its own shielded CNC pocket for optimal isolation. Sit back and be immersed</p><p>You can’t underestimate the importance of a clean power supply. A re-imagined design paired with the DAC reduces the noise floor even further. We’ve equipped the DAC with a single supply for the digital side of the DAC, along with an isolated supply for the analog side, yielding an unprecedented level of performance.</p>'
