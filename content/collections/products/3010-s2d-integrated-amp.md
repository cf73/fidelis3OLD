quote: 'Don’t let the simple façade of the Exposure 3010S2D integrated amp fool you. It may not have outer glitz and glamour but it’s a real standout when it comes to inner beauty. The Exposure 3010S2D is an honest and classy piece of work that honors the finest traditions of the high end.'

    excerpt: '<p><b>Exposure 3010S2D Wins the 2017 Absolute Sound Editor’s Choice Award</b></p><p>The 3010S2D represents the fourth generation of Exposure’s top-tier integrated. It outputs 110Wpc of solid-state power. Like its predecessor it comes equipped with six line-level inputs, but now also includes an AV input for integration with a multi-channel system. A preamp output permits the addition of a separate power amp for system bi-amping. There are dual sets of speaker terminals (banana only). A remote control is included as well.</p>'
