quote: '“The Dynaudio Emit M30 is not only an exceptionally good loudspeaker design, one that measured extremely well on Newport Test Labs’ test bench, it’s also an exceptionally well built loudspeaker and therefore gets my very highest recommendation,”'

description: '<p>The M30 floorstanders share the same DNA as our top-of-the-line loudspeakers. Their twin 17cm MSP bass drivers each feature a large 75mm aluminium voice-coil (larger voice-coils mean more windings, which means more control over dynamics, detail and finesse), and their 28mm soft-dome tweeters have rear damping chambers for even greater precision. It’s the sort of thing you might expect to see in much higher-priced speakers. And it’s the sort of sound you might expect, too.</p>'
