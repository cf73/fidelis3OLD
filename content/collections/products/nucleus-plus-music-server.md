description: '<p>The Nucleus and Nucleus+ appliances were conceived to bring Roon to a wide audience of music lovers, particularly those who aren’t highly technical or interested in do-it-yourself (DIY) projects. By tightly integrating high-performance hardware with an optimized operating system and purpose-built software, they provide a simple way to get the richest possible Roon experience. They represent the culmination of an extensive product design and engineering effort, combining the Roon team’s years of experience designing media server hardware and extensive software development expertise.</p><p>The Nucleus product line was developed with several goals in mind:</p><ul><li>A turn-key Roon&nbsp;<i>Core</i>&nbsp;that does not require a Mac, PC, or NAS</li><li>Computing power to support Roon’s requirements now and in the future</li><li>Ease of use – little to no customer support required after installation</li><li>Software and firmware updates downloaded “over the air” and managed by the end user</li><li>Reliable and robust operation –&nbsp;tamper-resistant and nothing to service</li><li>Audiophile-friendly –&nbsp;no fans or moving parts</li></ul>'
