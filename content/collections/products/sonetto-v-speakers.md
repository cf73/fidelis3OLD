quote: 'The Sonetto V is the best of all worlds, as it does seem to  combine what was good about the Venere – a sense of ‘directness’ and purpose of sound... and the lower price, of course – with the increased refinement and top-end openness of the Olympica models.'

    excerpt: '<p>The Sonetto V is at the perfect junction in audio. It draws more than you might think from the Olympica loudspeakers in terms of outright sound quality but does so at a fraction of the cost of a similar Olympica speaker design, and it does all this while carving out its own elegant aesthetic and sonic performance that is extremely entertaining, especially to those who might never fully embrace the ‘live, unamplified music’ ethos of traditional high-end.&nbsp;</p>'
