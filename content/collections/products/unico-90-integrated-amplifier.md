description: '<p>Unico 90 is a class AB hybrid integrated amplifier with zero feedback, as the most precious valve amplifiers uses only two stages. The heart of the Unico 90 circuit is found in its hybrid structure. All of the gain, and subsequently the "character" of the amp, is determined by the only tube stage made with ECC83 and ECC 81in particular multiple-parallel-totem-pole.</p>'
