description: '<p>Grado has taken one of the world''s most legendary headphones and made it even better. The SR80e has a new driver design, a new polymer to&nbsp;damp resonant distortion in the plastic housing, and a new cable from plug to driver connection. The way the SR80e''s new driver and plastic housing move air and react to sound vibrations&nbsp;virtually eliminate&nbsp;transient distortions. This allows the signal flow over the new cable to reproduce sound that has improved&nbsp;tight control of the upper and lower range of the frequency spectrum, while&nbsp;supporting Grado''s world renowned midrange. The SR80e will produce a sound that is pure Grado, with warm harmonic colors, rich full bodied vocals, excellent dynamics, and an ultra-smooth top end.</p>'
