description: '<p>The RB220 uses Regaâ€™s custom one piece, aluminium arm tube, carefully manufactured to optimize performance and reduce stress on the Rega designed ultra low friction polymer bearings (patent pending). Each tonearm is meticulously hand assembled using custom Rega made tools and torque settings to guarantee optimum performance. This level of care ensures perfect tracking and maximizes the amount of information the cartridge can extract from the record surface.<br>The RB220 has preset bias making this arm even easier to set-up than previous models. The Rega designed bias system will adjust the amount of bias as the tonearm tracks the record ensuring even tracking and negating the need for user setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
