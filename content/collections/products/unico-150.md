description: '<p>The Unico 150 amplifier has been designed to suit both high-end audiophile and highly scientific criteria. This dual-approach to development has led to the creation of a product that is different to anything Unison Research – or any other manufacturer – have developed before: a powerful, great-sounding amplifier with only three stages (two tube stages and one power MOSFET stage).</p>'

    excerpt: '<p><strong>Unico 150 Unison Research most powerful amplifier<br></strong><br>The Unico 150 with its 150 watts per channel @ 8 ohms is Unison Research most powerful amplifier and that is for good reason.&nbsp; Building an amplifier with higher power can mean adding more stages to the circuit to increase the gain.&nbsp; With the Unico range the amplifiers are either a 2 or 3 stage circuit, with the Unico 150 being the latter.&nbsp; The company have designed the amplifiers with as few stages as possible, a less is more philosophy.&nbsp; The first two circuit stages are valves used to give the amplifier its “character” with Unison Research choosing specific pure class A Tridoes based on certain key performance factors.</p><p>The dual mono, zero feedback solid state amplification&nbsp;stage is a class A/B design that can provide 220 watts per channel into a 4 ohm load.&nbsp; It is supported by two large torodial transformers that are capable of 400VA + 400VA continuously.&nbsp; Unison Research have chosen to use Mosfets in the Unico 150 that are capable of handling 1200w and 50amps so they are always working well under capacity.</p><p><strong>More good than just tubes in the preamplifier</strong></p><p>The tube preamplification stage is a hightlight feature of the Unico 150 but its far from all that is good about it .&nbsp; It has an armoured ALPs Potentiometer, the inputs are connected only one at a time with armoured mechanical relays separating&nbsp;them and deflecting&nbsp;any potential RF noise other connected cables could introduce as potential antennae.</p><p>​For the balanced inputs transformers are used for a truly balanced transmission creating a theoretical infinite ground reference.&nbsp; Unison Research have chosen Mundorf capacitors for critical circuit positions, using them in parallel to reduce the effects of parasitic capacitance and to ensure low inductance.&nbsp;&nbsp;These design inclusions were made after vigorous listening tests to ensure&nbsp;the right performance, despite their extra cost.</p><p><strong>Sounds good very quickly</strong></p><p>The Unico 150 has a short warm up cycle before you can use it, the left and right channel power indicator LED’s flash during this cycle.&nbsp; The manual states a 10 minute warm up period but in reality I think the Unico 150 sounds good straight away, it’s not an amplifier&nbsp;you will need to turn on an hour before you want to listen to it.</p><p>It does get fairly&nbsp;hot in use but thanks to the huge heat sinks&nbsp;and the well ventilated top the heat is limited to above the heat sinks rather than the whole amplifier becoming part of the heat sink as it does in a lot of cases.&nbsp; I would still suggest good ventilation as being important here.</p><p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p><p>I started the review full of hope that a Hybrid&nbsp;Integrated Amplifier could have all the positives&nbsp;of both tubes and solid state technologies without any of their drawbacks.&nbsp; Does the Unico 150 hit a home run and achieve this near impossible task, not quite but it does make a very good justification for the hybrid amplifier because&nbsp;there is definitely&nbsp;something&nbsp;in it.</p><p>More importantly it has exceeded my expectations&nbsp;for an integrated amplifier at this price point.&nbsp; The Unico 150’s qualities were very obvious to me during the review period but it’s overall quality wasn’t made apparent until I took it out and realised how much I missed it.&nbsp; A musical presentation that is full of life, energy and most impressively soul.</p><p>Spending time with the Unico 150 and enjoying its many performance strengths&nbsp;justifies audiophiles decisions to use a tube preamplifer with solid state amplification&nbsp;in separates&nbsp;form.&nbsp; The comboination works at creating a very engaging, lively, sweet and easy to listen to musical experience that can hold your attention and keep you in the listening seat&nbsp;for many hours without fatigue&nbsp;or worse boredom.</p><p>The Unico 150 strikes a nice balance, it makes you aware of a recordings strengths&nbsp;and weaknesses without ever punishing them to the point of being un-listenable, even at loud volumes.</p><p>The big thing here is the price, the Unico 150 is $6495 at the time of writing and I think presents fantastic value for money for what it delivers.&nbsp; I would prefer a few changes to the visuals and construction and would happily pay a few hundred pounds premium for them but in reality these are far from deal breakers.&nbsp; Its not a perfect amplifier but I do feel it could be Its not a perfect amplifier but I do feel it could be pretty much most things to a lot of audiophiles who favour musical involvement.</p><p>The Unison Research Unico 150 deserves our Special Performer Award, it has impressed me no end and has me intrigued to explore the audio world of valves.&nbsp; If you are shopping at around this price level you should hear it for yourself.</p>'
