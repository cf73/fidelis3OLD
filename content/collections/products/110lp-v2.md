    type: Review
    excerpt: '<p>I am rather impressed with this diminutive box of Phono tricks.&nbsp; If you are in the market for a moderately priced phono stage for a new record player, I would recommend the Moon 110 LP v2 for a good long audition.&nbsp; Then you might as well just buy it!.&nbsp; The same goes for a new cartridge investment, if you are buying a new cartridge, or turntable, this need not now lead to you replacing the phono stage every time and if you are on an audiophile journey (many incremental changes over a period of time), as I am, you would do well to start your phono stage journey here, and not buying another one.&nbsp; If I had auditioned this before I purchased my existing MM phono stage I would have done very well over these last six or seven years.</p>'
