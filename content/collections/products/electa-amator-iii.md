quote: 'The Electa Amator III ''the best I''ve heard from the brand since the original Guarneri''. Yes, it''s that impressive, that commanding, that correct. It does exactly what the late Franco Serblin demanded of all his creations: it reproduces music so convincingly that the listener is transported. Bravissimo!'

    excerpt: '<p><i>35 years on from Sonus faber''s birth, a blessed return to the values on which it was founded: the Electa Amator III</i></p><p>Two blasts from the past in one month, both small two-way monitors, both with a massive presence in my hi-fi history, but so dissimilar that loving both seems like a case of schizophrenia. As with the LS3/5a, I have been a devotee of Sonus faber for over 30 years, though of late the passion has cooled. But something tells me that the company has again found its mojo, and the Electa Amator III is its herald.</p>'
