quote: 'But it’s not just that the Dynaudio Evoke 50s have a big sound… it’s that they sound fabulous, with super-extended, effortless bass, superb midrange and transparent highs, along with stereo imaging to die for. As you can tell, I loved the sound of these speakers, and I think you will too.'

description: '<p>Evoke 50 is a full three-way floorstander with a 28mm soft-dome tweeter, a 15cm neodymium midrange driver and twin 18cm woofers.</p><p><strong>Come in on a high note<br></strong>Evoke 50 features Dynaudio’s newest tweeter: Cerotar. It’s a brand-new, ground-up design that uses key technologies from the award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter, the awesome new Contour series and the all-singing, all-dancing tech-fest that is the all-new Confidence. Our engineers are very proud of it. As well they should be.</p><p>The Cerotar is powered by a brand-new strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system. That gives it more sensitivity, which, in musical terms, translates simply to ‘honesty’. You’ll hear just what you’re supposed to hear. And because it’s so smooth and natural, you can listen for hours without getting tired.</p><p><strong>Big bottom<br></strong>Down at the bottom are two 18cm Esotec+ woofers. Like the Cerotar tweeter, they use trickle-down technology from the Contour and Confidence families to bring as much of that high-end DNA to Evoke as possible.</p><p>The woofers are made from our own proprietary material, MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer). We’ve been using it in our cones for decades – and we’ve yet to find anything that gives a better balance of lightness, stiffness and damping. If it ain’t broke…</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>Great news! Dynaudio has trickled down one of the technologies it uses in its high-end loudspeakers to a totally affordable model. The ‘Hexis’ geometry Dynaudio developed specially for its Esotar3 tweeter—as used on the company’s Confidence range—is now fitted to the latest Dynaudio Evoke 50</p>'
