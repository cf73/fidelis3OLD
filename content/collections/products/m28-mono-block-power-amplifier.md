quote: 'Bricasti Designs'' M28 is a powerful, beautifully built amplifier. Its sound is surely the result of deliberate design choicesâ€”from top to bottom, it spoke with one voice. Given its design pedigree, I''m sure it will produce impressive measurements on JA''s test bench. But I need more metal, where and when it''s called for. The Bricasti M28s might have provided the perfect match for my older reference speakers, the Wilson Audio MAXX 3s, whose sound had more metal on top.'

    excerpt: '<p>Overall, though, I still found the M28''s overall sound, though fully extended on bottom, to be only moderately well-articulated compared to my far more expensive reference monoblocks, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/content/dartzeel-nhb-458-monoblock-amplifier">darTZeel NHB-458</a>s (or to what I recall of the Soulution 710''s sound). However, the M28 was faultlessly rich and smooth in the critical midrange, where most of the music lives. On top, it was sweet and less than fully open, but insufficiently fast and precise for my taste.</p><p><br></p>'
