description: '<p>The Sigma S12 features patented technologies and proprietary components that are simply unavailable in other products. Shunyata Research power distributors supply power to multiple components while reducing noise from the power line and intercepting&nbsp;<em>component-to-component&nbsp;</em>noise.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>DTCD®&nbsp;DESIGNED (<em>Dynamic Transient Current Delivery</em>)</h3><p>The Sigma S12 was designed using Shunyata Research’s DTCD®<strong>&nbsp;</strong>analyzer. DTCD®&nbsp;Analysis measures instantaneous current through extremely low-impedance electrical conductors and contacts.&nbsp; Shunyata Research uses it to optimize the design and performance of our power conditioners and power cabling.</p><h3>CCI™ NOISE REDUCTION</h3><p>Traditional power conditioners are designed to block incoming noise from outside the home but do not address the noise that is generated by the electronic components themselves. In fact, most conditioners reflect noise back into other components connected to the power conditioner. CCI™ (<em>Component-to-Component Interference)</em>&nbsp;is one of the most significant but often overlooked aspects to power system performance. Shunyata Research’s CCI™ filter consists of a proprietary multi-stage filter that reduces electrical noise and power supply generated interference.</p><h3>NIC™ NOISE REDUCTION</h3><p>The NIC™ (<em>Noise Isolation Chamber)</em>&nbsp;is a patented technology that reduces high-frequency power line noise. NICs™ use a non-reactive&nbsp;<em>ferroelectric</em>&nbsp;substance that actually absorbs high-frequency noise. This allows the Sigma S12 power distributor to reduce noise without any of the negatives associated with conventional power conditioner designs.</p><p>[ US Patent 8,658,892 ]</p><h3>GP-NR NOISE REDUCTION</h3><p>When it comes to reducing noise, engineers focus primarily on the AC electrical lines, with little thought given to the ground lines. The incoming ground line and the internal power conditioner ground plane can actually act as antennae, drawing in electrical noise that may interfere with the operation of the connected components.&nbsp;<em>Ground Plane Noise Reduction</em>&nbsp;is a proprietary technology developed by Shunyata Research to significantly reduce interference caused by this phenomenon, thereby providing a more pure audio experience.</p><h3>ZONES OF ISOLATION</h3><p>The Sigma S12 features six zones of isolation configured in such a manner that each duplex is individually isolated. This design principle provides for high levels of noise isolation while delivering exceptional audio and video performance.</p><h3>&nbsp;HIGH CURRENT CAPABILITY</h3><p>The Sigma S12 is rated at a full 20 Amps of continuous current, ensuring unfettered power delivery to complex entertainment systems, including those with high-powered amplifiers. Advanced electromagnetic breakers in addition to massive buss and 8-gauge ArNi<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;provide exceptional dynamic contrast and bass impact.</p><h3>HYDRAULIC ELECTROMAGNETIC BREAKER</h3><p>Common power conditioners use fuses or thermal breakers for over-current protection. When heavily loaded, they may cause voltage drops, increased contact impedance, thermal noise, excessive heat generation, and current-limiting effects. The Sigma S12 uses a more advanced solution called a&nbsp;<em>hydraulic electromagnetic breaker</em>&nbsp;that operates right up to the maximum current rating without the limitations of fuses or thermal breakers.</p><h3>CopperCONN®&nbsp;OUTLETS</h3><p>All commercial grade connectors and virtually all audiophile grade connectors are made from a brass or bronze base metal. Some audiophile grade connectors may get a plating of nickel, silver, gold or rhodium which is only a few millionths of an inch thick. The Shunyata Research CopperCONN®&nbsp;is constructed using<em>&nbsp;solid, high purity, oxygen-free copper</em>&nbsp;as the base metal with a flash coating to protect the copper from oxidation. The CopperCONN®&nbsp;outlets and connectors are designed to provide superior grip strength and contact integrity. This contributes to a measurable improvement in DTCD®&nbsp;performance and a correspondingly obvious difference in audible performance.</p><h3>CABLE CRADLE SUPPORT SYSTEM</h3><p>Shunyata Research includes a unique solution to the problem of heavy high-end power cables. The Cable Cradle supports the weight of the power cables, preventing them from pulling away from the outlet. This system is designed to ensure reliable and secure electrical connections.</p><h3>ArNi®&nbsp;CONDUCTORS</h3><p>Shunyata Research has developed a proprietary line of ArNi<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;conductors. They are made from certified OFE C10100 (<em>Certified ASTM F68</em>) copper. The wire strands are arrayed in a unique&nbsp;<em>hollow tube</em>&nbsp;VTX™ geometry that reduces skin effects. ArNi<sup>®&nbsp;</sup>conductors are treated with Shunyata Research’s exclusive&nbsp;<em>Kinetic Phase Inversion Process&nbsp;</em>(KPIP™) for a period of 8 days.</p><h3>VIBRATION MANAGEMENT</h3><p>Mechanical vibration can be very destructive to system performance. The Sigma S12 was designed from its inception to include advanced forms of vibration control that improve the recovery of subtle musical detail and nuance. All chassis panels and internal structures are treated with vibration-dampening materials. The outlets are isolated from the chassis with vibration-dampening gaskets that reduce vibration conducted through the AC cables. All internal modules, filters, and electronics are encapsulated in a vibration-absorbent compound.</p><h3>KPIP™ “BLACKBIRD” PROCESSOR</h3><p>Each Sigma S12 is treated with Shunyata Research’s proprietary&nbsp;<em>Kinetic Phase Inversion Process (KPIP™).&nbsp;</em>The<em>&nbsp;KPIP™&nbsp;</em>dramatically reduces burn-in time and significantly improves sonic performance.</p><h3>CRYOGENIC TREATMENT</h3><p>Many of the electrical components in the Sigma S12 are treated in Shunyata Research’s own advanced&nbsp;<em>computer-controlled</em>&nbsp;cryogenics lab. Further cryogenic treatment of the unit is strongly discouraged, and will void your warranty.</p><h3>SSF-50 SHUNYATA FOOTER</h3><p>The Sigma S12 includes Shunyata Research’s SSF-50 isolation footers, specifically designed to reduce vibration from the supporting platform. Power distributors react very similarly to amplifiers in relationship to floor-borne vibration. After researching multiple forms of energy dissipation methods, Shunyata Research developed the SSF-50 to provide the performance characteristics of an expensive after-market isolator but at a fraction of the cost.</p>'
