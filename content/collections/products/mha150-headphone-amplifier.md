description: '<p><strong>McIntosh''s MHA150 headphone amplifier/DAC</strong>&nbsp;takes on all comers in its product category. Buttressed by a<strong>&nbsp;high-resolution DAC that supports up to 32-bit/384kHz PCM, DSD256, and 384kHz DXD via a USB input</strong>, MHA150&nbsp;<strong></strong>brings the signature technologies, engineering, and design of McIntosh''s hallmark stereo amplifiers to a personal-listening device that has no peer. McIntosh''s patented Autoformer is utilized to yield three headphone impedance ranges – 8-40, 40-150, 150-600 ohms – to ensure every type of headphone fully and completely benefits from the captivating sound produced by the&nbsp;<strong>U.S.A.- built MHA150</strong>. The inclusion of McIntosh''s&nbsp;<strong>Headphone Crossfeed Director (HXD)</strong>&nbsp;further enhances the fidelity and makes recordings image as if they were being played back by speakers. Speaking of loudspeakers: While the compact dimensions permit the&nbsp;<strong>Roon-Tested MHA150&nbsp;</strong>to easily fit on a desk or nightstand, this 26-pound unit is so powerful and authoritative, it even has a 50-watt output for driving loudspeakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
