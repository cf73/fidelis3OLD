description: '<p>Rockport Technologies is proud to announce the Atria II as the successor to our acclaimed Atria. While maintaining the elegant form of its predecessor, the Atria II establishes an entirely new level of musical realism.</p><p>Capitalizing on the benefits of our new waveguide mounted beryllium tweeter, we have completely redesigned the crossover in the Atria II to create a fundamentally transformed loudspeaker. The Atria II also uses our latest generation of custom, carbon fiber sandwich composite cone drivers designed and developed from the ground up by Rockport Technologies.</p><p>Both the bass driver and midrange driver utilize a revolutionary new carbon fiber fabric in their cone construction that further increases the stiffness/weight ratio of the cones, ensuring pure pistonic behavior throughout their entire operating range. The midrange and bass drivers also feature newly designed cone profiles as well as state of the art, ultra-linear, high-power motor systems. The result is vanishingly low distortion, incomparable resolution, and enormous dynamic range.</p><p>One of the most important design considerations for the Atria II was that it would play music with a far greater sense of scale and ease than one would ever expect for a loudspeaker of this size. We’re extremely pleased that we’ve met or exceeded all of the design goals for the Atria II. And, while it was designed to work well in smaller rooms, make no mistake, the Atria II is a lionhearted speaker that surprises on every level.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>“Some of my friends have asked me in the past what Speaker’s I lust over, if cost were no object. That answer is easy, Rockport Audio Atria II’s. I’ve heard the Atria’s before, but this was the first time listening to the Atria II’s, and the associated equipment was much better this time. Rockport Speakers generally measure excellent, among the best in the industry. They are built to a luxury standard befitting their high price tag. Their sound…Always impressive. Their resolving power is uncanny, you tend to hear things you didn’t know where in the recordings. The imaging is outstanding, placing instruments with spooky realism. The bass is tight, subtle, deep, and extended. In fact, most of the time I feel like there isn’t enough until it hits you. The speaker is so neutrally balanced, I find myself thinking something is wrong. Yet in the end I recognize what I’m hearing is accurate. Everything is as it should be.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
