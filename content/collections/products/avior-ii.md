description: '<p>While carefully preserving the original Avior’s distinctive form, the new Avior II is the epitome of high performance and visual elegance in a loudspeaker which although modest in size, delivers authentic, full range sound.</p><p>Immediately apparent is the potent combination of our new waveguide mounted beryllium tweeter and our latest generation of 6″ midrange and twin 9″ carbon fiber sandwich composite bass drivers. This, in conjunction with an entirely redesigned crossover, has allowed us to essentially create a completely new loudspeaker. The Avior II’s sound is even more transparent and resolved than the original, and is characterized by a rich, textural liquidity and authoritative dynamic fidelity throughout the entire frequency range.</p><p>The Avior II’s waveguide mounted beryllium tweeter improves the acoustic impedance match of the tweeter at the low end of its range, and allows for lower distortion and greater dynamic expression from the tweeter itself, as well as improved dispersion characteristics at the midrange/tweeter crossover point.</p><p>The Avior II’s triple laminated, constrained mode damped enclosure boasts a solid 6 inch thick front baffle and variable section thickness, gracefully curved side panels and crowned top surface. Together, these not only create an elegant form, but also endow the enclosure with immense stiffness and minimum resonant signature. The enclosure’s large sweeping chamfers and ever changing baffle dimensions virtually eliminate diffraction anomalies, while the Avior II’s visually stunning, raked back form and high gloss piano black finish are the ideal complement to its awesome sonic accomplishment.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>The Rockport Technologies Avior II is a neutral, uncolored, full-range loudspeaker capable of both rocking-out loudness and the presentation of subtle sonic differences. It’s not entirely without character—the slight coloration I noted with solo-piano recordings will be a problem for some. But that aside, its superb transparency doesn’t get in the way of the music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
