description: '<h3>The Majestic S/5</h3><p>S/5 exceeds the mandate for mid-level models and crosses this model into true reference quality. S/5 produces exceptionally low bass with tremendous impact and speed. Even difficult-to-render instruments such as pipe organs are dealt with effortlessly.Large scale, high end 2-channel systems make a perfect pairing for S/5 and grand theaters are ideal. Medium to grand rooms are appropriate. Scale is Very Large, Speed is Exceptional, Attack and Slam is Visceral.</p><p>S/5′ driver features an all-new alloy cone structure that takes our mid-level product to a performance that exceeds our reference products of only a few years ago. By reducing moving mass, with a balanced approach to design, our engineering team was able to produce far more speed than prior designs. By carefully adjusting key parameters, we were able to increase the self-quieting key to a high end component’s ability to resolve space and inner detail. Improvements in our designs translate into enhancement in your entire system.</p><p>S/5 uses a special carbon/carbon passive that is stiff, lightweight and incredibly well-behaved. Our approach to passive design results in performance more akin to a variable ratio driver size. On an S/5, think of it as a sliding ratio design wherein the S/5 begins as an ultra-fast 12″&nbsp;sealed box design and, as more power and deeper bass is demanded, the S/5 gradually morphs into the power and output of a 15″ design.</p>'

specifications:
  - 'Beyond our proprietary drivers, the performance of a REL is determined by our unique input filters and amplifiers. REL S/5 uses a simple filter-type that is very fast, about 8 milliseconds in group delay, to cross out unwanted higher frequencies to our driver. This speed and our carefully sorted filters allow for seamless blendingof RELs with the main speakers. REL do not include a high pass filter to cross out bass from the main speaker because to do so would generally produce more unwanted effects than the minor benefits such a design confers.'
  - 'S/5’s power amplifier is a powerful NextGen2 550W digital amplifier. This design has powered thousands of RELs and has proven exceptionally reliable and very fast with deep, extended lows it provides a perfect mate to our new driver.'

    excerpt: '<p>REL makes superb active subwoofers in general and this one is so good, it is peer to at least one 15in model and other products nearly twice the price. In the S5, driver and amplifier engineering have created a new benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
