    excerpt: '<p>Exposure has added a monobloc power amplifier, the XM9, to its compact XM series.</p><p>Rated with an output of 80-watts into 8Ω, the Exposure XM9—despite its small size—does not use a switch-mode power supply, but instead features a linear power supply with a large 200VA custom-made toroidal power transformer… and not surprisingly, because Exposure’s chief designer,&nbsp;<strong>Tony Brady</strong>, is no fan of switch-mode power supplies. ‘<em>While most smaller hi-fi components—and indeed a good many larger ones—fall back on switch-mode power supplies… they’re far from audiophile grade and pollute the mains supply with noise,’</em>&nbsp;he told Australian Hi-Fi Magazine. ‘<em>I’ve also used only high quality resistors and capacitors in the XM9’s signal path and, in the output stage, Toshiba bipolar output transistors that have been carefully chosen for their superior dynamic performance</em>.’</p><p>According to&nbsp;<strong>Bill Plantzos</strong>, National Sales &amp; Marketing Manager for RVM Australia, which distributes Exposure in Australia, the arrival of the XM9 is further proof that high-performance hi-fi does not need an ‘XXL’ space and budget. ‘<em>”Real world” hi-fi at “real world” prices is something Exposure has always been particularly strong on and the XM series is no exception, offering smart solutions for music lovers who want superior hi-fi performance,</em>’ he told Australian Hi-Fi Magazine. ‘<em>The XM Series is the first of Exposure’s ranges to cleverly pack a full quota of high-quality features into a narrow, half-width design and this new XM9 is a perfect partner for the recently-released XM7 preamplifier.</em></p>'
