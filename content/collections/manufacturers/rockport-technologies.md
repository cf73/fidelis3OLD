description: '<p>We are so excited to bring Rockport Technologies Loudspeakers to Fidelis, they are among the very best in the world!</p><p>From Rockport Technologies founder and chief designer Andy Payor:<br>“I was privileged to have a love for music instilled in me at an early age by my parents. The profound effect that music has in the way we think and feel, and to evoke memories, has always inspired me.</p><p>Our main objective at Rockport Technologies is to pursue the ultimate in sonic performance from our loudspeakers, separating ourselves from common “me too” products by virtue of extraordinary, relevant applied technology and execution. Every aspect of our designs has been implemented in a way that transcends the engineering and production approach found in other audio products. Rockport Technologies products have always been on the cutting edge of the performance envelope, because we are willing to spend the time and effort to utilize the most technologically advanced materials and processes to design and manufacture our loudspeakers.</p>'
